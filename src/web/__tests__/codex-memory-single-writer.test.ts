// #447 — the one Codex event the single-writer election did not cover.
//
// Every event the rollout watcher produces goes out through emitCodexEvent,
// which carries the per-batch verdict of writesCodexLog: N decks tailing one
// rollout all DRAW it (that fan-out is #405's whole point) and exactly one of
// them appends it to the events.jsonl they share. `maybeResolveCodexMemory` —
// the AGENTS.md scan #399 added — pushed with no opts at all, so pushEvent fell
// through to writesLogFor, which answers from `foreignSessions`. That set is
// filled by exactly one thing, noteLogWriter off an incoming hook POST marked
// `?persist=0`. A Codex rollout is read inside the server and never reaches an
// HTTP handler, and the installer keeps the Codex provider for uninstall only,
// so a Codex session id can never get into that set: every deck answered "mine"
// and every deck wrote the line.
//
// WHAT IT COST, MEASURED, because the honest size of a bug belongs next to its
// fix. The scan is throttled to one call per session per CONTEXT_READ_THROTTLE_MS
// (4s) AND only runs on a tick where the rollout actually grew, so the ceiling of
// ~900 lines/hour/deck is a session that produces bytes in every single 4-second
// window for a solid hour. Replaying the 10 real rollouts under this machine's
// CODEX_HOME through that gate — 38.5 hours of session wall-clock — fires it 270
// times, i.e. 7 per session-hour, not 900. At 412 bytes a line that is 111 KB per
// extra deck across those 38 hours: 0.2% of the 50 MB the log rotates at, and it
// would take ~141 hours of unbroken Codex activity per extra deck to fill one
// rotation. On disk this is a tidiness fix.
//
// Where it is not tidiness is the line COUNT. Those same 10 sessions produce 612
// real events between them, so with two decks up the duplicates are 270 of 1152
// lines — 23% of the log — and boot replay pushes every one of them through the
// 2000-entry ring buffer, evicting genuine tool calls from what a reconnecting
// tab is shown. That is the cost worth fixing, and it is a cost in eviction
// rather than in wrong state: the reducer's ContextObserved branch assigns
// field by field, so a duplicate is idempotent. The last test here pins that,
// because "it double-counts" and "it wastes a slot" want different fixes and
// the difference is not obvious from the payload.
//
// Plain node, no DOM: the first two tests drive the real watcher against a real
// rollout in a temp sandbox, the third drives the real reducer.
