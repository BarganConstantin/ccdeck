// #400: three defects on the surfaces that turn Codex tokens into dollars.
//
// 1. RATES stopped at gpt-5.2 and the whole 5.1 / 5 estate — gpt-5, gpt-5-codex,
//    gpt-5.1, gpt-5.1-codex, gpt-5.1-codex-max, the mini and nano tiers — priced
//    out at nothing. What that looks like on screen is NOT `$0.00`: every
//    surface gates its cost element on the figure being positive, so the element
//    disappears and the tokens stay, and the usage panel's two tables filtered
//    on `cost > 0` while the token strip above them summed the same sessions.
//    The panel's headline therefore matched no visible row. The same file has a
//    catch-all on the context-window side (`/^gpt[-_]5/i` → 400K), which is what
//    proves the ids were expected to arrive.
// 2. `cache_write_input_tokens` is in every `total_token_usage` Codex writes and
//    reached the reducer verbatim, which read only Claude's spelling and dropped
//    it — so gpt-5.6, the first OpenAI family to publish a cache-write price,
//    had a rate with no count to multiply.
// 3. The 7-day token line is a pure local read of the rollout files. It rendered
//    inside the branch that requires the Codex QUOTA fetch — an authenticated
//    round trip to chatgpt.com — to have succeeded, so the one number needing no
//    network was withheld whenever the network failed.
//
// Measured here before any of it was written, on this machine, cold cache:
// /api/codex-usage answers in 2-4ms with zero outbound requests; /api/codex-quota
// takes 991-1299ms across two HTTPS GETs. Of the 171 `total_token_usage` objects
// in ~/.codex/sessions, `cache_write_input_tokens` is present in all of them and
// non-zero in none — 0.0000% of 7,782,286 tokens — so claim 2 is a latent
// under-report rather than a live one, and every number below is unchanged by
// the fix on today's data. That is also what makes the double-charge question
// answerable only from the payload's own arithmetic: `total_tokens` equals
// `input_tokens + output_tokens` in 171 of 171 objects, and each qualifier field
// (`cached_input_tokens`, `reasoning_output_tokens`) is ≤ its headline, so the
// identically-shaped write field is part of `input_tokens` too.
//
// No DOM here — plain node, no jsdom — so the panel and the card are read as
// source the way manage-block.test.ts and panel-overflow.test.ts read theirs,
// and everything arithmetic goes straight through pricing.ts, which is pure.
