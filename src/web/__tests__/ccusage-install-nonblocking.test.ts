// #476. The boot-time ccusage install froze the whole process for as long as
// npm took — up to INSTALL_TIMEOUT_MS, two minutes — on exactly the machine
// where npm is slowest: a first run with nothing cached.
//
// The wrapper read as if it did not:
//
//     _installing = (async () => { installSync(spec); })()
//
// An async function body runs synchronously up to its first `await`, and there
// was none, so the IIFE converted a throw into a rejection and bought no
// asynchrony at all. `installSync` — a `spawnSync` of `npm install ccusage` —
// ran on the caller's stack, and the caller is `primeCcusage`, which bin/deck.js
// calls at boot beside genuinely async neighbours (ensureCswap, versionReport)
// and which answers `{ state: "installing" }`, a sentence that says the wait was
// deferred. It was not: no HTTP accept, no SSE write, no hook ingestion and no
// pulse line could happen until npm exited.
//
// The stubs below are the whole argument. One `npm install` takes NPM_MS either
// way — the difference is only WHERE those milliseconds are spent. `spawnSync`
// spends them on the caller's stack, which is what a busy-wait models honestly:
// a synchronous spawn is not a sleep the loop can do something else during.
// `spawn` spends them off it, and answers through the event loop like the real
// thing. A timer scheduled BEFORE the prime, due immediately, is then the
// probe: it cannot run while the stack is busy, so a blocked loop can only run
// it AFTER npm has finished.
//
// What the probe reports is that ordering, not its own lateness. Lateness is
// how busy the runner was, and reading it as a freeze is what put this file in
// #586: a timer 253ms late on a loaded machine failed a 100ms threshold while
// the deck was behaving perfectly. Whether npm had finished when the timer ran
// is a fact about where the milliseconds went, and no runner is slow enough to
// change it.
//
// The rest pins what the fix may not cost: the vector npm is handed (#456's
// absolute `npm.cmd`, the quoted `--prefix` of #362, `windowsHide`, no shell),
// the deadline, the shared-promise dedupe, and the post-check that refuses to
// call a zero exit a success when nothing runnable came of it (#432).
