// #339: the deck ships under three npm names, every surface it draws says
// ccdeck, and 95% of the downloads are on the other two. So it says so — once
// in the terminal, once in the browser — and the whole risk of doing that lives
// in one question: which name did the USER type?
//
// Asking the package instead is the trap this file exists to keep shut.
// ccdeck/package.json depends on agents-deck and ccdeck/bin/ccdeck.js spawns
// ../../agents-deck/bin/agent-dag.js, so "is this build agents-deck?" is true
// inside every ccdeck run — a notice keyed on it would scold precisely the
// people who already did what it asks. That case is asserted here by name.
//
// The second half is that the answer does not exist everywhere. npx records the
// typed spec, a POSIX global install carries it in argv[1] because node does
// not resolve the bin symlink, a Windows global install loses it inside npm's
// .cmd/.ps1/sh shim, and a git checkout never had one. Four shapes, two of them
// unknowable, and unknowable must produce silence rather than the likeliest
// guess — a notice that fires at the wrong person is the one that teaches
// everyone to ignore the next one.
//
// Pure functions and source text only: plain node, no DOM, so the banner cannot
// be rendered and the terminal rows are rebuilt here out of the same term.mjs
// primitives bin/deck.js draws them with.
