// A browser told to block site data does not hand back an empty store: the

// no error boundary, so a throw escaping one of those rejected root.render()
// and left #root empty — a blank deck under Safari's "Block All Cookies",
// Chrome with site data blocked, or Firefox in strict mode, with nothing on
// screen naming the cause. These pin that an unreadable store reads as "not
// stored" so the caller keeps its default and the deck still mounts.
