// `npm i -g agent-dag` had the same defect #358 fixed for `npm i -g ccdeck`,
// reached by a different route — and was explicitly left out of that change.
//
// #340 has since removed the stub, so a FRESH `npm i -g ccdeck` produces the
// plain global shape like the other two. The "stub" layout in the table below
// stays because it is still on disk everywhere ccdeck was installed before that
// change, and the deck has to get those installs their first upgrade off it.
//
// #358 taught the deck to read the name it was REACHED under out of the layout
// npm built, which is the only place the stub's name survives: `npm i -g ccdeck`
// nests the deck at `<prefix>/lib/node_modules/ccdeck/node_modules/agents-deck`,
// so the package one directory up is the one an upgrade replaces. `agent-dag`
// has no such layout. It is this tarball republished with its manifest renamed
// (publish.yml: `npm pkg set name=agent-dag`), so the deck IS the whole package
// and sits directly under the global node_modules with nothing above it —
// hostPackage correctly finds no host, and the answer fell through to `name`'s
// default of `agents-deck`. Nothing in the deck ever passes that parameter, so
// the default WAS the answer: an `agent-dag` user was told to run
// `npm i -g agents-deck@latest`, which installs a second, unrelated global
// package and leaves their `agent-dag` binary exactly where it was, while the
// version check cached its answer in a marker named after a package this
// install is not.
//
// What both renamed republishes carry is their own package.json, which the
// rename made authoritative. This file pins that it is read — for all three
// global names in one table, at the two places a name becomes an act (the
// command the user is shown and the argv npm is spawned with), and in the
// marker the answer is cached under. #358's two layouts, npx under each of the
// three typed names, and a git checkout are pinned alongside them, because the
// whole risk of reading a new source of truth is that it outranks one that was
// already right.
//
// The layouts are built on disk in a temp sandbox, the way
// stub-global-upgrade.test.ts builds them — nothing is installed, nothing is
// downloaded, and npm is a recording fake that never runs.

 *   "stub"     — `npm i -g ccdeck`: the deck nested inside the stub's own
 *                node_modules, which is what npm >= 7 builds for a global
 *                install with a dependency.
 *   "npx"      — `npx <typed>`: the deck in a content-addressed cache with
 *                npm's own record of the typed spec one level up.
 *   "project"  — a package that merely depends on the deck. Identical in shape
 *                to the stub layout, and not one of this deck's names.
 *   "checkout" — the maintainer's own tree: a manifest and a .git beside it.
