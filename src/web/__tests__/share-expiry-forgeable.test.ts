// The share envelope's expiry is not a security control, and the UI used to say
// it was.
//
// `wrapShare` base64-encodes plain `{v, exp, payload}`. There is no MAC, no
// signature and no key anywhere over it, so anyone holding the text can decode
// it, write a later `exp`, re-encode and import it. The ten minutes is advisory.
//
// This file does NOT add a signature, because one would prove nothing. A MAC
// needs a secret both decks hold, and two decks that already shared a secret
// would not need a share blob; and even a verified envelope would only close
// this one import path, since the payload inside it is the account's OAuth token
// in the clear and `cswap import` takes it directly. What the expiry really buys
// is that a copy left in clipboard history or a chat window stops working
// through the dialog — hygiene against forgetting, not defence against anybody.
//
// So the property is pinned rather than assumed, and the strings that overstated
// it are pinned too. If someone later adds a real envelope MAC, the forgery test
// below is the one that will fail, and that failure is the signal to come back
// and re-read this comment rather than to delete it.
