// #331: a light-theme user saw the dark deck on every single load.
//
// The attribute the whole stylesheet keys on was written from a useEffect, and
// effects run after the browser has painted. Worse, the sheet's first rule is
// `:root, :root[data-theme="dark"]`, so the attribute-less frame is not an
// unstyled one the eye forgives as loading — it is the finished dark deck,
// `color-scheme: dark` included, which drags the browser's own scrollbars and
// form controls along with it. Those are chrome, not CSS: they repaint on their
// own schedule and the correction is visible.
//
// The preference was already known synchronously — App reads it in a useState
// initialiser — so only the DOM write was late, and no bundle can make it early
// enough: the entry is a module script, module scripts are deferred, and the
// browser may paint while that chunk is still in flight. The fix is a classic
// inline script in <head>, which is parser-blocking and therefore runs before a
// frame exists.
//
// That script cannot import theme.ts — an import would make it a module and
// defer it again, which is the bug — so the rule is written twice. Rather than
// trust the two copies to stay in step, this suite EXECUTES the inlined text
// against a fake window and compares its answer to resolveTheme() over the same
// inputs, throwing store included. Plain node, no DOM: `new Function` with
// `window` and `document` as parameters shadows the globals the script reaches
// for, so the browser is never involved.
