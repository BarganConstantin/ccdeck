// #338: a deck in a background tab said nothing at all.
//
// index.html's <title> is static markup and `document.title` was assigned
// nowhere in src/web/, so the tab strip — the one surface of this deck that is
// on screen while the deck is not — read identically whether five sessions were
// blocked on a permission prompt or nothing had moved since lunch.
//
// Three things are pinned here, and only one of them is the arithmetic.
//
// The first is the ORDER of the title. `(2) ccdeck` and `ccdeck (2)` differ by
// nothing a reviewer would defend and by everything a user sees: browsers
// truncate a tab title from the end, so the appended form is clipped away at
// exactly the widths a deck is read at. It looks like a mistake, which means
// somebody will eventually fix it — so the count is asserted at index 0 rather
// than merely present, and that fix fails here.
//
// The second is that the ICON IS DRAWN. It was a `<text>◉</text>` font glyph,
// which is a shape borrowed from whatever font the machine happened to resolve:
// three weights on the three platforms, and a tofu box wherever U+25C9 is
// missing. Decoration can survive that. State cannot — three states that all
// render as the same box are one state. So the markup is asserted to contain
// circles and no text, and the three fills are asserted to clear 3:1 against
// both a white tab strip and a #1f1f1f one, since the page has no way to ask
// which it is on.
//
// The third is that neither write happens on a frame that changed nothing. The
// effect sits on the SSE path, where `running` churns constantly under a title
// that is not moving.
//
// The fourth is WHAT COUNTS, which is the one this file got wrong. #348
// narrowed the alarm to `permission` blocks and left `idle` out of it; this
// file kept its own hand-written copy of the old expression and was not touched
// by that commit, so from #348 until #377 the suite asserted the superseded
// counting as correct behaviour — a green test standing over exactly the
// regression it was written to catch. The copy is gone: the counting cases
// below call ambient-counts.ts, which is the same module App.tsx and
// SessionList.tsx count with, so there is nothing left here that can drift from
// what ships.
//
// Plain node, no DOM — so this tests the pure functions, reads the two source
// files as text, and drives the reducer directly for the counting.
