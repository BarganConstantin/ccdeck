// #417, the half that is about the next rename rather than this one.
//
// When Codex renamed its shell tool to `exec`, SIX lookup tables missed it at
// once — TOOL_CATEGORY, TOOL_EMOJI, CODEX_PRIMARY_LABEL, SHELL_TOOLS and
// CODEX_TOOLS in ToolBursts.tsx, plus DETAIL_TOOL_CAT in App.tsx, whose comment
// claimed the duplication was "small enough that a shared module isn't worth
// it". Six of six missed, which is what a set of parallel tables does: adding a
// name costs six edits and misses at least one, and the miss is silent because
// every table has a plausible default — "other", the ✨ fallback, the raw name,
// no sub-bubble. The result is indistinguishable from the deck being broken.
//
// So the Codex half of all six now derives from ONE spec table, and these pin
// that it really does: for every Codex tool name the deck knows, the bubble the
// canvas draws must match the spec in every field, and the bucket the detail
// panel counts it under must be the same bucket the canvas tints it with. A
// name added to the spec is a name all six know, or these fail.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest. App.tsx cannot be imported here (React, JSX,
// reactflow), so its half is pinned two ways: behaviourally through the shared
// function it now calls, and structurally by reading the file to prove it calls
// it rather than keeping a seventh copy of the table.
