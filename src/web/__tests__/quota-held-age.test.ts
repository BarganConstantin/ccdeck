// `claude --print /usage` routinely answers without its "Current session/week"
// lines — a cold invocation, or right after a hard refresh — and the branch that
// handles it keeps serving the last reading the deck did get rather than
// regressing the panel to 0%. It used to re-stamp that reading with
// `fetchedAt: now`, and fetchedAt is the age of the DATA, not of our read of it:
// the usage panel printed "just now" over percentages collected hours earlier,
// held it for a full poll cycle, then snapped back to the true age — an age
// label that oscillates and periodically vouches for numbers the deck itself has
// already marked stale. self-update.mjs keeps `at` (when npm answered) apart
// from `failedAt` (when the last attempt failed) for exactly this reason; a held
// quota reading has to carry the timestamp of the answer it actually is.
//
// Nothing here spawns the claude CLI, reads claude-swap's store or reaches the
// network: child_process and claude-accounts.mjs are replaced wholesale, and
// every home the module resolves at import time points into a temp directory.
