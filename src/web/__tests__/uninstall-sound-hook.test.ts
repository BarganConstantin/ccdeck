// after the deck was supposedly gone. Worse, turning the toggle on parks the
// user's own afplay/PowerShell Stop hooks in ~/.agents-deck/parked-sound-hooks.json
// and only the running deck UI can put them back; once uninstalled, hooks the
// user wrote themselves were stranded in a file they had never heard of. These
// tests drive the real CLI and pin both halves: the deck's entry goes, and the
// user's own hooks come back.
