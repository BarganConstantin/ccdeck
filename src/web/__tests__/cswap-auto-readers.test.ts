// The two readers behind /api/cswap-auto, tested against the text the CLIs
// actually print (#383). Both were exported with no caller outside their module
// and both are the kind of thing the sweep that filed #383 was warned about: not
// dead code, but a decision made by one regex against output the deck does not
// control, with nothing pinning it.
//
//   - `readCswapConfig` parses `cswap config`. Its answer IS the auto-switch
//     settings panel, and it is also `tickInterval`'s only input — a value it
//     misreads becomes the interval the deck polls Anthropic on.
//   - `externalAutoRunning` decides whether the deck's own loop stays silent. A
//     wrong `true` is a feature that quietly never runs; a wrong `false` is two
//     engines moving the user's live Claude account with no single place showing
//     why. Its Windows half runs a completely different command from its POSIX
//     half, and neither could be seen from the other before this file.
//
// Nothing is spawned: `run` answers from the test, so a regression is a wrong
// parse rather than a real `ps` or a real PowerShell on the machine running the
// suite. Plain node throughout — these are string readers, not components.
