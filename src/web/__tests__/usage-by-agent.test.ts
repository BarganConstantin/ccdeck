// #431. The usage-history modal's subtitle read "via ccusage · local Claude /
// Codex logs" and the chart under it showed one merged number, so the panel
// named two CLIs and then refused to tell them apart. "How much of this is
// Codex?" had no answer anywhere on it — the model legend shows per-model cost,
// which is the closest thing, and it is exactly where eyeballing breaks down: it
// is long, it changes week to week, and adding it up means already knowing which
// model ids belong to which CLI.
//
// ccusage has computed that split all along. `daily --by-agent --json` adds one
// `agents` array per day, and the deck never sent the flag.
//
// What is pinned here, in the order the answer travels:
//
//   1. the argv — the flag is on the vector, with and without `--until`;
//   2. the fallback — an older ccusage that rejects it costs the split and not
//      the history, and the reader is shown no error;
//   3. what is remembered about that, which is narrower than what is retried;
//   4. the parse — a real `--by-agent` payload, measured from ccusage 20.0.20
//      on a machine running both CLIs, reaching the browser intact and rolling
//      up to figures that sum to the day totals already on screen;
//   5. the one-CLI and no-CLI machines, which must see the panel they see today.
//
// TEST ENVIRONMENT. Plain Node, no jsdom, so nothing here renders React — which
// is why the arithmetic and the copy live in usage-agents.ts and
// provider-copy.ts rather than in the modal. HOME, PATH and AGENTS_DECK_CCUSAGE
// are redirected before ccusage.mjs is imported, the way the six sibling ccusage
// files do it: this file's subject is which ccusage the deck runs and with what,
// so it must not find the developer's own managed install or a global copy on
// their PATH, on any platform.
