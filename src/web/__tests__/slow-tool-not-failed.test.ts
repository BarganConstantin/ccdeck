// #436: any Claude tool call still running after ninety seconds was drawn as a
// FAILURE, and the cause the deck named for it was untrue.
//
// `sweepStaleTools` judged a call on its own age: `now - t.startedAt > 90_000`
// stamped `ok = false` and `errorPreview = "stale (no PostToolUse received)"`.
// Five surfaces read `ok` — the burst dot's colour, the tool row's status, the
// ToolModal's error styling, the detail panel's error count and the session
// summary's "Errors" stat — so the call went red on all of them and stayed red
// until its real PostToolUse arrived and resurrected it.
//
// ── what the real log says ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1420 Claude calls with a matched PreToolUse -> PostToolUse pair, from this
// machine's events.jsonl (metadata only — event names, tool names, timestamps):
//
//   p50 438ms   p90 5.7s   p95 19.1s   p99 63.0s   max 776.2s
//   over 90s: 13 calls (0.92%) — 12 Bash, 1 AskUserQuestion
//   over 600s: 2 calls
//
// Every one of those 13 was healthy and returned normally; the worst was drawn
// red, and counted in the Errors stat, for 686.2s. Against them the sweep caught
// 3 calls that were genuinely orphaned. Four out of five of its verdicts were
// false, on a signal the user acts on — a red Bash is a build you go and kill.
//
// ── why it is not a bigger number ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Ninety seconds sat below Claude Code's own Bash timeout (120s default, 600s
// max), so the sweep fired inside the CLI's documented operating range. But 600s
// is no safer: two measured honest calls ran past it, because PreToolUse fires
// before the permission decision and a call parked on a human has no bound at
// all — the same shape as the Codex approval prompt #397 was about. No threshold
// on the call's own age can work, because "slow" and "lost" overlap on that axis.
//
// The rule is now the session's silence rather than the call's age, on the
// window `sweepStaleSessions` (#350) already defends as the point at which a
// session is presumed dead. A call settles only once the session it belongs to
// has stopped emitting entirely — which is the evidence the sweep was always
// really looking for, and the only evidence that separates the two cases.
//
// Note what that does NOT rest on. A foreground tool call is the whole of what
// its session is doing, so the session is silent for the duration of the call by
// construction: all 13 false positives ran on sessions whose longest silence
// inside the call window was the call itself. Reading `lastEventAt` against the
// OLD ninety-second window would have condemned all 13 exactly as `startedAt`
// did. The clock and the window had to change together, and the tests below pin
// both — the middle describe would pass on the pre-fix source if only the clock
// had moved.
//
// Which way this chooses to be wrong: a genuinely lost call now lingers as a
// spinner instead of settling at ninety seconds. It still settles — every one of
// the 3 real orphans measured here belonged to a session that did eventually
// fall silent — just later, and only once there is evidence for it. A spinner
// that outstays its welcome is a smaller lie than a failure that never happened.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the reducer directly and
// re-derives the two surfaces inline the way App.tsx computes them.
