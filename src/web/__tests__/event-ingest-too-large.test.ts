// POST /api/event past its 5 MB cap answered with nothing at all.
//
// handleEventIngest called `req.destroy()` inside its `data` handler and then
// returned. Destroying an IncomingMessage destroys the socket under it, so the
// poster did not hang — it got a connection reset, which is worse in the way
// that matters: it is exactly what a deck that crashed, or that was never there,
// looks like. There is no status code anywhere in that exchange to tell the two
// apart. `end` never fires on a destroyed request either, so the handler had no
// second chance to say anything.
//
// readBody (64 KB, everywhere else) gets this right by rejecting into a caller
// that replies. This route now answers 413 first and drops the socket only once
// the reply has flushed, since destroying a socket discards whatever is still
// queued on it.
//
// hook/hook.js is the only client that posts here. It reads the response and
// then calls its finish callback, and it holds a 1-second timeout over the
// whole thing — so it survived the reset and survives the 413; what it gains is
// a status code that says which of the two happened.
