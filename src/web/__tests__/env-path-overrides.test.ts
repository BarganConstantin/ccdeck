// `quota.mjs` opened `~/.claude/.credentials.json` while Claude Code — and every
// other module on the Claude side of this deck — honours CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR,
// which REPLACES ~/.claude rather than overlaying it. The failure is silent by
// construction: a missing credentials file is indistinguishable from a machine
// that keeps its token in the Keychain, so readOAuthToken() answered null
// forever and the quota chain skipped source 2 (one HTTPS GET, ~0.3s) for
// source 3 — up to three `claude --print /usage` child processes, ~3.0s each,
// each spending a request from the same ~28-30/hour usage budget that source 2
// would have spent one of. That budget is shared with claude-swap, and blowing
// it is what 429-ed claude-swap and emptied the accounts panel; see the header
// of src/server/quota.mjs and src/server/self-update.mjs.
//
// `bin/deck.js` printed `~/.codex/sessions` in the boot banner while the watcher
// in index.mjs tails `$CODEX_HOME/sessions`. Cosmetic until Codex sessions do
// not show up, at which point it is the only diagnostic the deck prints and it
// names a directory that does not exist.
//
// Everything below runs against a temp sandbox: HOME, USERPROFILE,
// CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, CODEX_HOME and claude-swap's store root all point inside
// it, so no assertion here can be satisfied — or contaminated — by the
