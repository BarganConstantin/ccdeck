// #337: the deck installs the `Notification` hook, the events arrive, they are
// written to events.jsonl — and `case "Notification": { break; }` dropped every
// one of them. So the deck always knew which session was sitting blocked on a
// human, the one question five parallel agents make worth asking, and showed
// nothing.
//
// Two things are being pinned here. The first is that waiting rides ALONGSIDE
// `state` instead of becoming a fourth AgentState: a permission_prompt arrives
// mid-turn while the session is active, an idle_prompt arrives after Stop while
// it is done, and a union would have destroyed one of those two facts whichever
// way it was written.
//
// The second, and the one that decides whether the badge is worth having, is
// the clearing. A badge that outlives the block is worse than no badge — it
// teaches the user to distrust the only signal the deck exists to give — so
// every event that is evidence the session moved takes it away, and the events
// that are NOT evidence leave it standing. The trap on that side is the three
// *Observed events: the server starts a transcript scan for every hook payload
// carrying a transcript_path, the notification included, so a rule of "any
// event clears it" would have cleared the block a second or two after it was
// set and no badge would ever have survived long enough to be read.
//
// No DOM here — plain node, vitest — so this drives applyEvent directly and the
// three surfaces that read `waiting` are checked by eye.
