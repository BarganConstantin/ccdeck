// The usage-history modal rendered its busy line only while `days.length === 0`,
// which is true exactly once — before the first response lands. After that the ↻
// and the four range presets changed nothing on screen: the reload button was
// never disabled and never swapped its label, and the chart, the totals strip
// and the legend went on showing the PREVIOUS range's numbers underneath the
// newly highlighted tab. The user clicked 7d, read 30d totals as the answer, and
// watched them rewrite themselves seconds later. The out-of-order guard in
// latest.ts had already made the landing correct; what was missing was any rule
// about what may be on screen in the meantime.
//
// These pin that rule: a response is shown only against the range it was asked
// for, and a fresh run over numbers that do answer the selected range marks them
// as not-final rather than passing them off as the result.
