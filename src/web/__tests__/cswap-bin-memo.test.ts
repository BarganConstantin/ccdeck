// allowed to change.
//
// `cswapBin()` is called on roughly twenty paths across cswap-admin.mjs,
// cswap-auto.mjs and claude-accounts.mjs — every add, switch, move, import,
// export, remove and poll. Each call would otherwise cost a `cswap --version`
// child process, so the answer is memoized; and because it is memoized, there
// has to be a way to invalidate it after an install, which is `resetCswapBin`.
// That pair is the contract this file pins, and it is the reason #383 kept the
// export instead of removing it as unused surface: `ensureCswap` is the only
// caller and its return value says nothing about which binary the twenty
// operations after it will be driven with.
//
// It also corrects the reading #383 was filed with. The call site's comment said
// the reset cleared a stale "not on PATH" answer; it never did — the not-found
// answer is returned without being cached, and the tests below say so. What it
// clears is a POSITIVE resolution that an install has since made wrong.
//
// Nothing is spawned and nothing on disk is read: `run` and `existsSync` both
// answer from the test. Plain node, no DOM.
