// `npx -y <spec>@latest` both downloads and executes, and the supervisor used
// that one command for the whole upgrade: the worker exited 76, the port was
// given up, and only then did npm find out it was offline, behind a proxy, or
// looking at a version that had not propagated. Every failed update was
// therefore a real outage — the SSE stream dropped, hook events fired into the
// gap lost outright — paid before anyone knew the update had a chance.
//
// So the download is now done on its own, while the old deck still holds the
// port. Which makes the argument vector the load-bearing part: the spec must
// reach npm as something to INSTALL and never as something to RUN, or the
// pre-flight starts a second deck and the cure is worse than the disease.
//
// The behaviour half is driven with real child processes, because "does it
// resolve false instead of throwing" and "is the process actually dead after
// the deadline" cannot be observed any other way. The children are two-line
// node scripts written into a temp directory: no npx runs here, nothing is
// installed, and nothing is downloaded.

/**
 * Settles once `child` has exited AND been reaped — the only moment at which

 *
 * This was `setTimeout(200)`, and #343 is what that cost: a fixed sleep is a bet
 * on the scheduler, not a fact about the child. On a loaded machine the signalled
 * process had not been scheduled to die inside that window, its pid was still
 * reachable, and the test failed — once in 22 full-suite runs. A process that HAS
 * died is no safer to ask about either: until its parent reaps it, it is a zombie
 * and `kill(pid, 0)` still answers "alive", on Linux and macOS alike. Node's reap
 * is a waitpid libuv performs BEFORE it emits `exit`, so the event is precisely
 * the fact the sleep was guessing at. Windows arrives at the same place from the
 * other side: the notification is the process handle being signalled, and the
 * taskkill killTree spawns there makes the wait longer than any sleep would.
 *
 * The exitCode/signalCode guard is load-bearing: node sets them in the same
 * breath as it emits `exit`, and `once("exit")` on a child that has already
 * exited never fires — waiting unguarded would trade the flake for a hang.
 *
 * The ceiling is generous and never paid on a healthy run, but a kill that truly
 * did not land then fails with the sentence below instead of as a bare vitest
 * timeout that says nothing about what went wrong.

/**
 * Where `flag` sits in `args`, or a failure naming the flag it could not find.
 *
 * indexOf answers -1 on a miss, and the case below spent that answer twice: as
 * the offset the spec is read FROM, and as the thing the spec's own offset is
 * compared AGAINST. A miss survives both readings — `args[-1 + 1]` is `args[0]`,
 * and every real offset is greater than -1 — so an argument vector with no
 * `--package` in it at all satisfied every assertion the case had (#650).
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical shape. It is the regression the comment inside the
 * case names — the spec handed over as a positional, which npx resolves, unpacks
 * AND runs, a second deck racing the live one for the port it is still holding.
 * `npxPrefetchArgs` reduced to `["ccdeck@latest"]`, the purest form of exactly
 * that, passed all three assertions; so did `[spec, "-y", "--call", "exit 0"]`,
 * which is the same command with the flags moved behind the positional. What
 * the miss costs depends on where the spec lands — `["-y", spec]` happened to
 * put something else at `args[0]` and did fail the first assertion — and a
 * contract that holds or does not hold according to the order of the arguments
 * it is reading is not the contract this case is written to state.
 *
 * Loud here rather than guarded at each call site, the way readme-order.test.ts's
 * `at()` covers its fifteen (#628): the point is that an offset a comparison is
 * built on must never be a sentinel the comparison happens to satisfy.
