// Starting a sign-in publishes nothing until its child exists, and getting
// there takes a store read plus `claude auth status` — a shell-out worth
// hundreds of milliseconds. Two requests that overlapped inside that window
// (two tabs, or one POST sent twice) both read the flow slot as empty, both
// walked past the already-running and yield-to-the-newer guards, and both
// spawned `claude auth login`. The later assignment won the slot, so the other
// child was unreachable: cancelLogin, the dialog's Escape, and the backdrop all
// stop `_login.child` and nothing else. What was left behind is not a stray
// object — it is an interactive process holding an open OAuth flow and an open
// stdin, invisible to the user, alive until its five-minute timeout.
