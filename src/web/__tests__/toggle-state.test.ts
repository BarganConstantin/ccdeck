// #370: the five icon toggles in the topbar are 30x30 squares that told you
// whether they were on in two channels, both of them hue at nearly the same
// luminance — and four of the five told assistive tech nothing at all.
//
// Four of them now. The session list's ☰ has since been removed from the row —
// the panel stays and L is the only way to it — and the last block below is
// what that removal left behind: the rule about disclosure toggles, asked of the
// two that are left, and the rule that a feature whose control is gone must
// still have a way in and a way out.
//
// The visual half, measured against BOTH ends of the topbar gradient rather
// than one of them, because a 30px button centred in a 52px bar is read against
// the whole of it:
//
//   channel                              dark            light
//   --accent-dim fill vs the bare bar    1.91 / 1.89     1.39 / 1.37
//   --accent edge vs the --ctl-edge it   2.65 / 2.74     1.67 / 1.52
//     replaces
//
// Each boundary is fine on its own — 1.4.11 is about a control against its
// surface and --accent clears it at 10.85:1 dark / 5.93:1 light. What none of
// it does is tell the two STATES apart, and in light neither channel reaches
// even 2:1. The report quoted 1.67:1 for the light edge, which is the friendly
// end of the gradient; at the other end it is 1.52:1, and that is the number a
// floor has to be written against.
//
// The semantic half: only the sound button carried aria-pressed. The usage
// panel, accounts panel, session list and usage history reported no state, and
// so did every category filter chip — while their bar claimed role="toolbar",
// an arrow-key contract it does not implement.
//
// The two halves are one fix here. The stylesheet keys the on state off the
// ARIA attribute, so a control cannot look pressed while reporting nothing.
//
// Plain node, no DOM — React cannot be rendered in this suite — so this reads
// styles.css and the markup the way control-edges.test.ts, quiet-signals.test.ts
// and manage-block.test.ts do, and computes every ratio from the sheet's own
// token values. The helpers are re-declared rather than imported from another
// *.test.ts: importing one registers its suites into this file as well.

// 1.14:1 / 1.19:1 against the two ends of the topbar gradient in dark and
// 1.60:1 / 1.41:1 in light, a fifth of what 1.4.11 asks of a state difference.

// It escaped #370 for a structural reason rather than a considered one: ON and
// ON_EXPANDED above name `button.btn.icon-btn`, and `.sysmeter` is a 50x24 box
// holding a sparkline and a memory bar, not a 30x30 glyph. So the invariant that
// pins every other disclosure in this bar simply did not apply to this one, and
// nothing failed when it drifted. It is named by hand here so it cannot drift
// again — and the last case below refuses the wrong repair, which is to give the
// meter the icon-button classes so that the existing sweep swallows it.
//
// The icon buttons' answer does not transfer, and the arithmetic for why lives
// here rather than only in the sheet's comment: an --accent fill is measured
// against the trace and the memory warning, and the measurement is what rules
