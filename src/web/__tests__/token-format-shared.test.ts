// One token count, three formatters, two answers. App.tsx and UsagePanel.tsx
// each carried a byte-identical private `fmtTokens` that stopped at millions,
// and UsageHistoryModal.tsx carried `fmtN` — the same function plus a billions
// tier (#257). Below 1e9 all three agreed, which is why the split lasted; above
// it the usage panel printed "2300.00M" for a cache-read total the modal beside
// it printed as "2.30B".
//
// The four-tier copy won, so the only value that moves is one past a billion.
// This file pins both halves of that claim: the tier boundaries and their
// rounding carries exactly as the old copies rendered them, and a sweep against
// the retired three-tier formula proving nothing below 1e9 changed. It also
// pins the two unrelated `fmtN` helpers that a blind rename would have eaten.
