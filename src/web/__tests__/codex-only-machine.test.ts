// A machine with only Codex was treated as a Claude machine at every lifecycle
// step (#402). It had claude-swap — a Python tool that switches Claude Code
// accounts — installed for it, fetching a `uv` binary first if it had to. It got
// the accounts panel open on first run, whose empty state reads "claude-swap is
// installed but has nothing in its store. Use the + above to sign one in", and
// following that reaches `claude auth login` against a CLI that is not there and
// dead-ends at "the claude CLI could not be run: not on PATH". And the boot
// banner told it to "sign in to Claude Code, then run cswap add".
//
// Nothing anywhere asked whether Claude Code was on the machine. The mirror was
// true too: a Claude-only machine permanently carried "Quota unavailable. / Run
// codex login to authenticate." in the usage panel.
//
// So there is now one answer — hasClaudeInstalled() — and everything the deck
// installs or opens on the Claude side hangs off it, with /api/health carrying
// it to the browser beside the Codex flag that was already computed.
//
// The presence test is the whole risk of the fix and most of what is pinned
// here. A false yes is today's bug, visible and overridable. A FALSE NO takes
// the hooks away from somebody who has Claude Code, which is a deck that never
// shows a single session and says nothing about why. So the cases below are
// mostly about the ways it must still answer yes.
//
// Everything runs against a temp sandbox: HOME, USERPROFILE, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR,
// CODEX_HOME and PATH all point inside it, so no assertion here can be satisfied
// — or contaminated — by the developer's own machine, and nothing is installed.
