// Reported: persistAuth() moved the freshly refreshed ~/.codex/auth.json into
// place with a bare rename. On Windows that call fails with EPERM/EBUSY while
// any other process — a virus scanner, the search indexer, the Codex CLI —
// holds the target open, which it does for a few milliseconds at a time. The
// refresh token is single-use and was already rotated server-side by then, so
// one lost race deleted the only copy of the new credential: the deck reported
// refresh_rejected and the user had to run `codex login` again. These tests pin
// the fix — the move goes through the installer's retrying rename, the same one
// the uv download uses — and the two guarantees around it that must survive:
// the rotated token never lingers in a temp file, and auth.json stays 0600.
//
// The sharing violation is synthesized rather than provoked, so the Windows
// behaviour is exercised on every platform the suite runs on.

// disagreed by a whole path: the sandbox was pinned at
// C:\Users\RUNNER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\… while every write persistAuth staged
// arrived as C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Local\Temp\…, the guard below refused
// all of them, and eight tests in this file and its neighbour reported the
