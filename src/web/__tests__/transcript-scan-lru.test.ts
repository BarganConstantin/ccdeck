// cache froze on what it already held for the rest of the process: every
// transcript after that
// re-read its whole JSONL from byte 0 on every ~2.5s pass instead of folding
// only the appended bytes, which is the O(n)-per-pass synchronous stall the
// cursor exists to remove. Totals stayed correct, so nothing but the cost of a
// long-lived deck ever showed it.
//
// These pin what the cache does once it is over the cap: the newcomer keeps
// its cursor, the path nobody has scanned in a while is the one that goes, and
// scanning a path again keeps it alive.
