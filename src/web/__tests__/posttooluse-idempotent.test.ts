// #444. `PostToolUse` WAS the only event in this reducer whose handler did
// arithmetic, and it was the only one of the four re-delivery-prone events with
// no guard against a second copy. `PreToolUse` refreshes a known id in place,
// `UserPromptSubmit` declines to re-append a prompt it already has, `pushActive`
// declines to re-push a key — and `PostToolUse` ran `addUsage(owner.usage, …)`,
// a `+=`, once per delivery. The tool list stayed right (one entry, one status);
// only the money moved.
//
// #685 removed the addition rather than guarding it: the value being added was
// the subagent's LAST API turn, which the transcript pass already counts out of
// that subagent's own file, so adding it here both double-counted those tokens
// and under-reported the delegated bill by ~98%. Tokens now have one writer —
// `UsageObserved`, which assigns — so the money assertions below moved onto
// that writer and onto the tool record. Everything else this file pins is
// unchanged and is still the reason the guard exists: `endedAt`, `ok`, the tool
// counters, and the sweep's verdict being overturnable exactly once.
//
// That re-delivery is not hypothetical. Replaying this machine's real
// events.jsonl + events.jsonl.1 (18,137 envelopes, a 22-hour window) finds 3,996
// PostToolUse deliveries covering 2,971 distinct tool_use_ids — 1,025 surplus
// copies, 25.7% of all deliveries, spread over 514 ids that arrived up to three
// times each, every copy carrying its own seq and 512 of the 514 spanning more
// than one server epoch, which is exactly the fan-out the file's comments
// describe. What that traffic did NOT contain is a single `tool_response` with a
// usage object in it, so the measured dollar drift on this corpus is $0.00: the
// arithmetic is live, the input to it happened not to arrive in this window.
// The re-stamping did land — `endedAt` moved by a median of 6ms and a maximum
// of 1,867ms per duplicated call, which is a call's drawn duration changing
// because of who delivered its outcome.
//
// The whole difficulty is telling a DUPLICATE from a LATE outcome. Both reach
// the handler with the call missing from `toolIndex` and `endedAt` already set,
// because the stale sweep (#436) settles a call and drops its index entry, and so
// does the first delivery of this event. The tests below pin that the two are
// separated by `outcomeApplied` — set only by an outcome event, never by the
// sweep — so a duplicate changes nothing and a late outcome still overturns the
// sweep's guess.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the reducer directly.
