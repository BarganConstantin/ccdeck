// Eight audit findings, all the same shape: a name only one side of the app
// knows about. `var(--fg)` and `var(--mono, …)` were read by rules nothing
// defines (#241, #247); `var(--fg-dim)` was read by a component and defined by
// nobody (#242); --cat-color was declared eight times and read nowhere (#245);
// .tool-chip, .now-running and .up-quota-header outlived the markup that used
// them (#243, #244, #246); .ctx-window-num was markup with no rule (#250).
// None of it failed, which is why all eight survived: an undefined var() is
// invalid at computed-value time and quietly inherits, and a selector that
// matches nothing simply never fires. So the halves are checked against each
// other here — every custom property the stylesheet reads must be written
// somewhere, every one it writes must be read, and the class names these
// issues retired stay retired unless markup comes back with them.
//
// What it does not catch: a rule whose class is composed at runtime — the
// stylesheet is full of `cat-*`, `state-*` and `status-*` selectors reached
// from template literals, and there is no DOM here to say which of them ever
// matched. Only the names on the watchlist are checked that way, so a new
// selector going dead is still a job for the next audit.
