// #369: two fixed-width panels could be scrolled sideways. One did it on every
// render, the other needed a name somebody typed.
//
// The usage panel is 280px wide with `overflow-y: auto`, which computes
// `overflow-x` to `auto` as well — a box cannot scroll one axis and let the
// other spill visibly. Inside it, `.cost-bar` declares `width: 100%`, which
// resolves against the panel's 278px content box, and `.usage-panel .cost-bar`
// then adds 14px of margin on each side OUTSIDE that width. Measured live in
// Chrome, in both themes: the panel reported clientWidth 278 and scrollWidth
// 306, the bar ran 1775 → 2053 against a content edge at 2039, and it was the
// only element in the whole app whose own box overflowed on an axis it had not
// been told to clip. The 28px is pure margin, so it is the same 28px at any
// content width — 265px of panel (280 less a classic 15px scrollbar, which is
// what Windows and Linux render) measured 263/291, also 28. After the fix the
// bar measures 250px and lands on 2025 with `.qb-track` and `.up-table`, and
// the panel reports 278/278.
//
// The accounts panel is the same failure with a different cause. `.ap-email`
// carried the full `min-width: 0` + `overflow: hidden` + ellipsis set;
// `.ap-alias`, its sibling in the same flex row and the one string here a
// person types, carried none of it, so `min-width: auto` floored it at the
// width of the name. Measured: the 288px panel began scrolling at a
// SIXTEEN-character unbroken alias — not the ~120px the report estimated, the
// row has more slack than that — and reached 22148px of scrollable width at
// 2000 characters, carrying `⋯` and the active badge out of the panel with it.
//
// The report's proposed CSS stops the scrolling and costs the email instead:
// with the ellipsis set but no cap, the alias took the entire 156.7px text
// budget and `.ap-email` — `flex: 1`, so a zero flex base size and therefore no
// share of the shrinkage — rendered at 0.0px from sixteen characters onward,
// present in the DOM and invisible on screen. The `max-width` is what keeps
// both: the alias freezes at 103.6px, the email keeps 53.1px, and the row is
// flat from 12 characters to 2000.
//
// None of that can be measured here. This suite runs in plain node with no DOM
// and no layout engine, so it reads styles.css the way manage-block.test.ts and
// dead-css.test.ts do and pins the RULES that make the overflow impossible: the
// width arithmetic, done in full, and the containment set on the alias. The
// second half pins the markup those rules depend on, because a rule that
// matches nothing protects nothing — which is how `.sl-dot` spent #373 scoped
// to a panel it was never inside.
