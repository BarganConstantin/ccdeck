// The port opens before the startup report finishes, not after it (#483).
//
// bin/deck.js used to `await reportStartup(jobs)` and only then call
// startServer, so the listener was not opened until every startup job had
// settled — and a job that is merely slow, not blocking, still kept the socket
// shut. `ensureCswap` is the live example: on a machine with no Python tooling
// it runs a real `uv tool install` under a 180-second timeout, so the deck
// printed its rows and then answered nothing for up to three minutes, on the
// first run, which is the one boot a new user judges the tool by.
//
// #476 fixed the other half of this — the ccusage install ran a `spawnSync` on
// the event loop — but a responsive process is not an open port. The symptom
// (a browser that cannot connect while the terminal looks busy) came from the
// ordering, and survived that fix.
//
// The technique is restart-boot-window.test.ts's, which is upgrade-no-outage's:
// an install layout in a temp directory holding the real bin/ and a src/server/
// of one-line `export *` shims onto the repo, so what runs is what ships. Three
// functions are shadowed and none of them is the thing under test:
//
//   ensureCswap    the slow job — held open by a file this test creates, so the
//                  race is arithmetic rather than luck and no assertion here
//                  depends on how loaded the machine is
//   versionReport  so no registry is contacted
//   keepDiscovery  so nothing is registered for a hook to find
//
// The second half asks the question the reorder created: the listen is now a
// promise that lives across the whole report, so a bind that fails inside that
// window has to be carried to the end of it and said out loud — not left
// unhandled for Node to answer by killing the process over a port it could have
// named.

 *  letting go of it — while the deck does not bind it until a whole node boot
 *  and the src/server module graph later, about 1.9 seconds here.
 *
 *  `listen(0)` is the wrong way to choose it, because it answers out of the

 *  which is the same pool every other `listen(0)` in this suite draws from, and
 *  more than twenty files here do. Anything asking the OS for an ephemeral port
 *  inside that 1.9s window can be handed this one, including another vitest
 *  worker in the same run. The deck then does the right thing and falls back
 *  into portRange — 4318-4400 — and this test, still knocking on the number it
 *  chose, reports "the port did not answer while the slow job ran", which is
 *  #483 regressing, which is not what happened. It also lands the deck inside
 *  the 4300-4410 range the guard below refuses, for thirty seconds, on a
