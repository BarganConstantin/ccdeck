// The `Last-Event-ID` catch-up loop wrote the whole ring buffer to the new
// client with bare `res.write` calls, so the one burst guaranteed to be large
// was the one burst MAX_CLIENT_BUFFER_BYTES did not cover: measured against a
// full ring of 2000 modest events, a single client that never read had 39MB of
// frames queued for it — ten times the cap by the cap's own accounting — and
// never fired 'close' to release any of it.
//
// The fix is flow control rather than a blind drop, and the difference matters
// in both directions. A client that reads must still receive every replayed
// event and the replay-end sentinel however far past the cap the ring is: the
// burst is the server's own doing, so hanging up the moment the buffer fills
// would hang up on healthy clients — repeatedly, since EventSource reconnects
// with the same Last-Event-ID and would meet the same oversized replay. A
// client that reads nothing is held at the cap and then hung up on, exactly as
// the live fan-out treats it.
