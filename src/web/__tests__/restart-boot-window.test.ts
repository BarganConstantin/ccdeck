// A restart asked for before the deck has finished starting up.
//
// The listener comes up from inside startServer, before that call has even
// returned to bin/deck.js — so POST /api/restart is answerable for the whole of
// the startup that follows it: the port report to the supervisor, the discovery
// file and its first fsynced write, and on a cold start the browser spawn.
//
// A restart landing in that window used to reach bin/deck.js's `shutdown`
// before the `const` holding it had been initialised and die of
// `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'shutdown' before initialization`. The throw
// itself was swallowed whole — the server's `catch` released its own half of
// the latch and said nothing — but bin/deck.js had already set `restarting`,
// and nothing in the process ever cleared it again. From then on the deck
// answered every restart, from every tab, with `200 {ok:true}` and did nothing
// at all: no restart, no update, no explanation, for the life of the process.
// Measured here at 65–261ms on a machine doing nothing else, wider on a cold
// boot and wider again on Windows, where `open` awaits a PowerShell lookup.
//
// Two halves, because the bug has two. The first drives the shipped server over
// a real socket and asks what it answers while the launcher has not reported
// ready. The second runs the real supervisor and the real bin/deck.js, with the
// one call the boot waits on — keepDiscovery().check() — held open long enough
// that the race is arithmetic rather than luck, and asks whether the deck comes
// back and can be restarted again afterwards.

 *  `killTree(child, "SIGKILL")`, which on POSIX is `child.kill("SIGKILL")` and
 *  reaches exactly one of them. SIGKILL cannot be handled, so the supervisor
 *  died without running the handler that stops its worker, and the worker was
 *  re-parented to init still holding its port, its temp directory and 40–60 MB
 *  of RSS. One per run of this file, every run, on every developer machine and
 *  every CI leg: 310 were alive on the machine that reported this, the oldest a
 *  day and four hours old.
 *
 *  So the stop is a stop rather than a kill: SIGTERM first, which is the signal
 *  the supervisor is written to answer — it kills the worker, waits for the
 *  worker's own shutdown, and then exits — and SIGKILL only if that has not
 *  happened in time. killTree is what carries the last resort to Windows, where
 *  there is no SIGTERM to answer and `taskkill /T /F` is the only thing that
 *  reaches a grandchild.
 *
