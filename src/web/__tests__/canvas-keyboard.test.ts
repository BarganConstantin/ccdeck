// #367: the canvas could not be operated without a mouse, in three ways that
// each hid the next.
//
// The first Tab killed every shortcut. App.tsx's window handler refuses to
// claim a keystroke aimed at a focused control, which is right — a bare "c"
// from a <select> truncates the event log — but every control on this deck is
// a <button> or a role="button", and Escape released focus only when the user
// was TYPING, which a button never is. Tabbing off the end of the document
// wraps to the first control rather than to <body>, so once focus left the
// body all thirteen single-key shortcuts were dead for the rest of the
// session, with no keyboard route back at all.
//
// The cards themselves were inert. React Flow makes every node a tabbable
// role="button" and answers Enter/Space itself — but its handler routes
// through updateNodesAndEdgesSelections, which only writes when the store owns
// the node array (`hasDefaultNodes`). This deck passes `nodes` as a controlled
// prop with no onNodesChange, so that write is skipped, the app's onNodeClick
// is never reached from the keyboard, and Enter on a focused card did nothing
// whatsoever: no selection, no ribbon, no detail panel, not even React Flow's
// own `.selected` class. And because the card wore role="button", the gate
// above killed j/k while it held focus, so the traversal shortcut could not
// rescue it either.
//
// And two thirds of the tab order announced as nothing: every clickable tool
// bubble was a role="button" tabIndex={0} inside the aria-hidden
// .tool-bursts-layer — 105 of a live deck's 166 focusables, each one a stop
// the accessibility tree says does not exist.
//
// Plain node here, no DOM and no renderer, so the decisions were moved into
// canvas-keys.ts and are checked directly; the parts that need a canvas are
// pinned by reading the source, the way manage-block.test.ts does.
