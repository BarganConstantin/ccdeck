// A failed ccusage run printed whatever `err.message` happened to be into the
// usage-history modal — "spawn npx ENOENT", "Command failed with exit code 1",
// or, when the browser could not reach the deck at all, the client's own bare
// "request failed". None of it says that ccusage is an external CLI the deck
// installs and runs, and none of it says what to do; the four ways a run can end
// mean four different remedies and /api/ccusage collapsed all four into one
// string, so there was nothing to map even if the modal had wanted to.
//
// So the route now tags the failure with the reason it knows — it raised three
// of them itself — and the modal answers from the reason map, the same ranking
// switch-failure-text.test.ts pins for claude-swap: the map speaks and the CLI's
// own bytes stay evidence on the title. These pin both halves, and the one case
// that only ever arrives inside those bytes: a machine without npx words it
// differently depending on how the fallback was launched — a plain spawn error,
// cmd.exe's "is not recognized", or, from a deck old enough to have used a
// shell, sh's or dash's own line.
