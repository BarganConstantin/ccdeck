// Who the `claude` CLI says is signed in, and what the deck does with an answer
// it cannot read.
//
// `currentIdentity` is the gate at the end of the add-account flow. After the
// CLI has accepted the verification code, `submitLoginCode` asks this question
// and refuses the whole sign-in when it comes back null — "signed in, but the
// claude CLI still reports nobody logged in" — and when it does not, the email
// it carries is what matches the fresh credential to a cswap slot, which is what
// puts the account on the right row of the panel.
//
// Only the null half of that had any coverage before #383, and only by accident:
// the login test asserts `no_identity` because the machine running the suite has
// no signed-in claude to answer. The half that decides where a successful
// sign-in lands had none at all, and cannot get any that way — it needs a real
// signed-in CLI on the host. So the parse is driven here directly, which is what
// the export is for.
//
// Nothing is spawned: `run` answers from the test. Plain node, no DOM.
