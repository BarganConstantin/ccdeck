// The rename to ccdeck, and the line it is not allowed to cross.
//
// The client kept introducing itself as agents-deck long after the repo, the
// command, the README and the terminal banner had stopped (#216, and #213 for
// the terminal half). What makes that a pinned boundary rather than a
// find-and-replace is that the old spellings are still load-bearing everywhere
// they are IDENTIFIERS rather than a name: the browser store is the
// `agent-dag.*` namespace, the state on disk is ~/.claude/agent-dag and
// ~/.agents-deck, the settings entries carry an `__agent-dag` mark, the
// variables are AGENTS_DECK_*, and npm publishes `agents-deck`.
//
// Renaming any of those fails silently, which is why it gets a test rather than
// a comment. A renamed storage key throws nothing and logs nothing — it reads
// as an empty store, so the first load after the upgrade discards the layout,
// the viewport and the pins of every existing user, and pruneStaleState (whose
// entire purpose is that the arrangement survives a version change) never sees
// the key it was watching. A moved directory orphans running decks from the
// hook that feeds them. A renamed AGENTS_DECK_NO_INSTALL turns an opt-out back
// on. So: the display name is asserted to be the new one on every surface that
// shows it, and each identifier is asserted, by name, to be the old one.
//
// Source text only — nothing here imports a module that touches the filesystem,
// so no HOME needs redirecting and no real ~/.claude is ever in reach.
