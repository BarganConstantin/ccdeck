// #462: one label over two models a 150x price apart.
//
// `shortModel` matched `gpt-<version>` and returned before it looked at what
// followed, so `gpt-5.4-nano` ($0.20/$1.25 per Mtok) and `gpt-5.4-pro`
// ($30/$180) both printed "GPT-5.4". Nothing was mis-billed — pricing.ts holds
// an ordered row per variant and every one of them is right — which is what made
// it worse than a label bug: the usage-history modal could put two rows a 150x
// price apart under one word, and a reader comparing them could only conclude
// the deck was wrong about the money.
//
// THE SCOPE IS NOT THE PAIR THE ISSUE NAMES. Sweeping every model id the deck
// can plausibly see — every one pricing.ts prices, every one
// CODEX_CONTEXT_DEFAULTS sizes, and every one this machine's own
// ~/.claude/agent-dag/events.jsonl and ~/.codex/sessions rollouts carry — found
// ELEVEN labels standing for more than one id. Eight of them were the defect;
// three are one model spelled several ways and are meant to collapse. The
// widest spread was in a family the issue never mentions: "GPT-5" covered
// `gpt-5-pro` at $15/$120 and `gpt-5-nano` at $0.05/$0.40, a 300x step under a
// single word. Both halves — the eight that had to split and the three that
// must not — are pinned below, because the corpus is the actual scope and the
// next family added to pricing.ts should be swept against it rather than
// eyeballed.
//
// Bare node, no DOM. `shortModel` is a pure string function, so it is called
// directly; the money consequence is driven through `ratesForModel` in
// pricing.ts rather than re-derived here, so what is pinned is the behaviour of
// the module that actually consumes the label. (A third consumer, the /-search,
// was removed with the search field itself — see the commit that deleted
// search-match.ts.)
