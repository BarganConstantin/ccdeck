// One model id, two labels, one screen. `shortModel` in AgentNode.tsx renders
// the model chips, the session rows and the usage table; the usage-history
// modal had a same-named private copy that only stripped prefixes, so
// `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` read as "Sonnet 4.5" in the usage panel and
// "sonnet-4-5" in the modal beside it (#251). Nothing was computed from either
// string, which is why it survived — but a family added to the shared helper
// reached four panels and never the fifth.
//
// The private copy knew two things the shared one did not: ccusage reports
// Bedrock ids with an `anthropic.` namespace on the front, and every Claude id
// ends in a release date. The shared helper read that date as a third version
// component — "Opus 4.7.20250101", where its own doc comment had promised
// "Opus 4.7" since the day it was written — so deleting the copy without
// folding both in would have been a downgrade, not a simplification. Both are
// pinned below.
