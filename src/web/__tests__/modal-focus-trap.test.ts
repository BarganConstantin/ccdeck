// #371: four of the six overlays announced `aria-modal="true"` — the claim
// that the rest of the document is inert while the dialog is up — over a
// document where every last control was still one Tab away.
//
// Three of them did not even take focus when they opened. `useModalDismiss`
// has accepted a `focusRef` since #366 and ToolModal, UsageHistoryModal and
// AddAccountDialog named none, so opening the tool modal from a tool bubble
// left the keyboard on the bubble: a screen reader's cursor outside a dialog
// that says nothing outside it exists reads as a page where nothing is left.
//
// And nothing anywhere contained Tab. From the last control in any of the six,
// Tab walked into the canvas, the toolbar and the panels behind the scrim —
// stops that are painted over, cannot be seen, and lead back out of the dialog
// the user is still reading. The issue counted 171 of them; that measurement
// predates #367, which took 105 tool-bubble stops out of the tab order, so the
// number is smaller now and the walk out is exactly as bad.
//
// Escape is deliberately untouched here. #366 gave it to the dismiss queue and
// #367 gave the loose-focus branch the blur that makes the next `j` work, and
// both still hold: a press that arrives while an overlay is open is "dismiss"
// and never reaches the branch that blurs. What the trap changes is that focus
// is now INSIDE the dialog when that press lands, which is what finally makes
// the unmount restore in modal-dismiss.ts do something — it only fires when
// focus fell to <body>, and before this it rarely had.
//
// Plain node, no DOM and no renderer, so the wrap itself is a pure rule in
// modal-dismiss.ts and is checked directly; the parts that need a document are
// pinned by reading the source, the way manage-block.test.ts does.
