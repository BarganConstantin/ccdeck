// #381: five regions, one landmark, no <h1>, and five aria-labels the
// accessibility tree was throwing on the floor.
//
// Measured on the shipped bundle, the deck answered a landmark query with one
// entry — HEADER.topbar — for an application that has a toolbar, a canvas and
// three panels. Everything else was a <div>. A screen-reader user could not
// jump to the canvas, could not jump to a panel, and could not tell one panel
// from another once they got there; the only route between them was Tab,
// through roughly a hundred and sixty-six stops.
//
// The heading outline was the same story one level down. There was no <h1> at
// all, so the document's first heading was the usage panel's <h3>Usage</h3> and
// every level under it was a skip. The only <h2> in the app was the detail
// panel's hero title, which appears when an agent is selected and not before.
//
// And the third finding, which is the one worth stating precisely because it
// looks like a non-bug in the source: `aria-label` on an element whose role
// resolves to `generic` — a <div> or a <span> with no role attribute — is
// DROPPED. It is not weakened, not a fallback; the name is discarded and the
// element stays anonymous. `.usage-panel` and `.accounts-panel` had carried one
// since they were written and neither had ever produced a name. #373 saw the
// shape and correctly called it a naming defect rather than a state one, which
// is how it arrived here.
//
// The issue counted two. A sweep of every aria-label in the bundle — the last
// test in the first block below, which is the part of this file that will
// still be doing work in a year — found five: the two panel roots and the
// three copies of the cost bar.
//
// Plain node, no DOM, so this reads the components as text the way
// manage-block.test.ts and toggle-state.test.ts do. Comments are stripped
// before any "appears nowhere" assertion, because this repo's comments quote
// the markup they replaced and a search for a retired shape would otherwise
// find the sentence explaining why it is retired.
