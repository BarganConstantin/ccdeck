// Reported: a discovery file outlives the deck that wrote it — SIGKILL, a power
// cut, anything that skips the shutdown path — and the only staleness check
// anywhere is a signal-0 probe of the recorded pid. Once the OS recycles that
// pid onto a long-lived process the file passes forever, while the port it
// names may by then belong to something else entirely (4317, the deck's own
// default, is also the standard OTLP collector port). Every hook event from
// every session — prompt text, tool inputs, tool results, cwd — was then POSTed
// there before a single byte of response was read.
//
// The fix makes the listener prove it is the deck that wrote the file: the deck
// stores a per-start random token there, and the hook sends nothing until the
// port hashes that token against a nonce it has never seen. These tests pin
// both halves — that an honest deck still receives events, and that a stranger
// on the port receives nothing but the challenge.
