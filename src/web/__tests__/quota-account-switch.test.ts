// Claude's 5h/7d percentages are one account's, not one machine's: quota.mjs
// reads them for whichever account claude-swap has active. Switching accounts
// from the accounts panel therefore invalidates every number the usage panel is
// showing — and the usage panel is the one component that cannot know, since it
// polls /api/quota on its own timer and the switch happened in a sibling that
// owns none of its state. So the server has to say so, and until this landed it
// said nothing: the roster flipped to the new account while the big quota bars
// went on showing the previous one's, two panels on one screen disagreeing about
// the same account, with the stale one being the one the user just clicked.
//
// Dropping the result cache is only half of it. `_lastGood` — the reading the
// deck already paid a request for — is what both of _doFetch's fallbacks hand
// back when nothing else can answer, and freshest() ranks it by fetchedAt, so it
// beats any store row for an account nobody has collected for since. Left in
// place it puts the previous account's percentages back on screen one poll later
// under a "stale" label, which is worse than an empty panel: the label vouches
// for them as this account's, merely old. #289 pinned that a held reading keeps
// the timestamp of the answer it actually is; a switch is the case where there
// is no answer to hold at all.
//
// Nothing here spawns the claude CLI or cswap, reads claude-swap's store or
// reaches the network: child_process and claude-accounts.mjs are replaced
// wholesale, and every home the module resolves at import time points into a
