// #445. `endedAt` on a root was being asked a question it does not carry the
// answer to. Both providers end a TURN with `Stop` — Claude's Stop hook fires
// when the main agent finishes responding, and the Codex watcher maps
// `task_complete` / `turn_aborted` onto the same name deliberately and per turn
// (#395) — and `Stop` is what writes `endedAt`. `pruneDoneSessions` then read
// `endedAt` as "this session is over" and evicted whichever finished longest
// ago, which on a real board is mostly terminals the human is still sitting in
// front of, thinking.
//
// The measurement that makes it a bug rather than the cap doing its job. On this
// machine's two event logs (20,864 envelopes, 22 sessions), 250 `Stop`s: 248
// were followed by more traffic on the same session and 223 (89%) by another
// `UserPromptSubmit`. The gap from a `Stop` to the next prompt has a median of
// 228s and a 75th percentile of 12.8 minutes, so only 89 of those 223 turn
// boundaries came back inside the shipped 2-minute grace — for 60% of them the
// deck was holding a still-open terminal in the eviction queue. Replaying both
// logs through this reducer with the real tick and the shipped constants (cap 6,
// grace 2 minutes) evicted 20 sessions, 7 of which went on to produce more
// events: a card vanishing from canvas and sidebar mid-thought and coming back
// on the next prompt as a brand-new node with no prompts, no tool history, no
// `firstPrompt`, no model, and `startedAt` reset to now.
//
// The distinction is carried by `closedAt`, written only by an ending of the
// SESSION — `SessionEnd`, or `sweepStaleSessions` giving up after
// STALE_SESSION_MS — and never by `Stop`. It ranks the eviction queue and does
// nothing else: `state`, `endedAt` and `waiting` are untouched, so the card, the
// session list and the two ambient counts read exactly what they read before,
// and the cap still holds exactly, because absence of `closedAt` means "not
// known to be closed" (a killed CLI sends no `SessionEnd`, and Codex has no such
// record at all) and never "still open".
//
// The second half is `pruneOldAgents`, which evicts agents one at a time in
// `endedAt` order and so deleted a root that finished before one of its
// subagents — leaving a card whose `parentId` resolves to nothing: no edge on
// the canvas, no row in the sidebar, no cost roll-up. `pruneDoneSessions` has
// held the opposite invariant since it was written; this pins it on both.
//
// The third is what #442 left here: a `Stop` that lands while a subagent is
// still `active`. It is NOT settled here, and the tests below pin that, because
// the premise that would justify settling it is false on current Claude Code —
// background subagents outlive the turn that dispatched them. On the same logs a
// `Stop` stepped over a still-open subagent 65 times and in 65 of 65 that
// subagent went on to emit its own tool traffic afterwards, a median of 606s and
// up to 10,455s more work. `sweepStaleSessions` settles the genuinely stranded
// one, on evidence rather than on assumption.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the reducer directly and imports
// the alarm counts from the one module that owns them (#377) rather than
// restating the rule.
