// #379: three token-level drifts in styles.css, none of which broke anything
// and all of which cost the panels their hierarchy.
//
//   1. One tier order inverted. `.ap-lane-label` is the reading key for an
//      accounts row — "5h", "7d", the model name — and `.ap-lane-reset` is the
//      footnote under it saying when the window rolls over. The label was
//      painted --text-dim and the footnote --muted, and --text-dim is the WEAKER
//      of the two by construction, so on white the 9px footnote read at 7.87:1
//      against the 10px name's 5.78:1: 36% stronger than the line it belongs to.
//      In dark the two tokens share a value, so the intended step did not exist
//      there at all and 10px against 9px was the only separation left.
//   2. Six rules dimming "this is inactive" at 0.5, 0.55 and 0.45 against eight
//      at 0.6 and a comment on `.ap-manage-btn:disabled` naming 0.6 as the
//      idiom. Two disabled buttons inside one modal — `.uh-reload` at 0.5 and
//      any `.btn` at 0.6 — dimmed by different amounts, which reads as one of
//      them being more broken than the other.
//   3. Eighteen distinct font sizes, eight of them inside the 3.5px band from 9
//      to 12.5 where the step ratio is 1.042 to 1.056. Nobody resolves a 5%
//      difference as rank, so those sizes had stopped encoding one.
//
// Two of the report's own numbers did not survive being measured again, and
// both are pinned below as what they actually are. Its opacity table lists
// `.cat-filter.off` at 0.38 — #368 deleted that declaration outright, so the
// divergence it names is already gone. And its usage-panel census quotes
// "`.qb-label` (11px)" beside `.up-k` (10px) as two spellings of one job:
// `.qb-label` has no font-size at all, only a colour, and renders at 11px by
// inheriting `.qb-meta`. Same conclusion about `.up-k`, one fewer declaration.
//
// The third fix is also narrower than the report asked for, on purpose. It
// wanted a six-step 10/12/14/18/26/34 ladder, which retires 11px (the sheet's
// most-used size, 42 declarations) and 13px as well. Those are 9% and 8% steps
// and they are load-bearing — `.agent-node` is 12px and its `.meta`, `.sub` and
// `.time` are 11px, which is the node's own body-to-secondary hierarchy — so
// collapsing them is a redesign rather than the removal of drift. What collapsed
// is every value within 7% of a neighbour, which is exactly the set that could
// not have been ranking anything.
//
// This suite runs in plain node — no DOM, no jsdom, no layout engine — so like
// quiet-signals.test.ts and panel-rhythm.test.ts it reads styles.css, parses it,
// and computes. The contrast helpers are re-declared here rather than imported
// from contrast-floors.test.ts: importing a *.test.ts registers its suites into
// this file too.
