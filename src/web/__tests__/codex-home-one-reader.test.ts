//
//   index.mjs        CODEX_HOME ? resolve(CODEX_HOME) : join(homedir(), ".codex")
//   installer.mjs    the same
//   codex-usage.mjs  CODEX_HOME ? CODEX_HOME         : join(homedir(), ".codex")
//   codex-auth.mjs   CODEX_HOME ?? join(homedir(), ".codex")
//   codex-quota.mjs  the same
//
// `??` falls back on null and undefined only, so the last two kept an empty
// CODEX_HOME — what `export CODEX_HOME=$SOME_UNSET_VAR` leaves behind — and then
// joined onto it. join("", "auth.json") is "auth.json", a CWD-RELATIVE path, and
// codex-auth.mjs is the module that writes OpenAI's single-use rotated refresh
// token back to disk: writing it to whatever directory the deck was started from
// does not lose a read, it burns the credential and costs the user a
// `codex login`. Meanwhile three of the five kept a relative CODEX_HOME
// verbatim, so it was re-resolved against the CWD at every readdir() instead of
// once at startup, and two modules read a different tree than the other three.
//
// THE TABLE IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE. Six shapes an environment variable can
// actually take — unset, empty, whitespace-only, relative, symlinked, trailing
// separator — crossed with every reader, all in one place, so a sixth reader
// added tomorrow with a spelling of its own has somewhere to fail.
//
// Each row's expected directory is written out here rather than obtained from
// the module under test: an expectation computed by calling codexHome() would
// agree with any rule at all, including the broken ones above.
//
// Everything runs against a temp sandbox — HOME, USERPROFILE, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
// and CODEX_HOME all point inside it — so no assertion here can be satisfied, or
// contaminated, by the developer's own ~/.codex, and nothing can write a
