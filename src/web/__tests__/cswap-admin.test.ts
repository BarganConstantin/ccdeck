// ── where Windows really keeps a pip-installed console script (#552) ─────────

// installers put it". Its two Windows Python entries were
//
//     %APPDATA%\Python\Scripts
//     %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Scripts
//
// and NEITHER can exist on a real machine. CPython always inserts the
// interpreter version between the root and `Scripts` — `pip install --user`
// writes `%APPDATA%\Python\Python312\Scripts`, which is sysconfig's `nt_user`
// scheme (`{userbase}\Python{version_nodot}\Scripts`), and the per-user
// installer writes `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts`. A user
// who ran `pip install --user claude-swap` and whose Scripts directory is not on
// PATH therefore missed every candidate: `cswapVersion` answered null,
// `ensureCswap` reported `not_on_path`, and the deck re-ran a whole install
// attempt on every launch for a tool already sitting on the disk.
//
// The old test asserted `p.includes("Python\\Scripts")`, which is why this was
// green for as long as it was: it pinned the literal the code produced instead
// of a location that exists. The version segment is a fact about the machine, so
// the fix reads the directory rather than guessing a range of version numbers —
