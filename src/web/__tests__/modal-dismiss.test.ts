// Escape closed three of the deck's five modals and did nothing in the other
// two. ContextModal and SessionSummary registered no keydown listener at all,
// so the only way out was to Tab to the ×, and SessionSummary is the one that
// opens by itself when a session ends. The three that did listen fought the
// window-level handler in App.tsx, which mapped the same key to
// clearSelection(): one press closed the tool modal and wiped the canvas
// selection behind it. And because nothing stopped propagation, every modal on
// screen answered the same press — the clear prompt raised over a session
// summary took the summary with it.
//
// These pin the queue that replaced all of it: one owner per press, the
// topmost overlay is the one that answers, the prompt that paints above a
// summary keeps its Escape even when the summary arrived later, and an
// unmounted modal stops answering. The last case pins the focus that used to
// fall to <body> instead of back to the .ctx-donut that opened the modal.
