// The claude-swap store had two path resolvers: claude-accounts.mjs, which the
// Accounts panel reads through, and a private copy in cswap-admin.mjs, whose
// readStore() diffs sequence.json before and after `cswap add` to work out
// which slot the new account landed on (#252). They agreed on an ordinary
// machine and disagreed on a Linux one with a relative XDG_DATA_HOME: the copy
// joined it as given, resolving the store against whatever directory the deck
// was launched from, while the reader ignored it as the XDG base-dir spec
// requires. Two roots means the panel reads one store while the add-detector
// looks at another and reports a successful sign-in as having created nothing.
//
// The spec-correct one won and is now exported and shared. These tests pin the
// rule and, more importantly, pin that both halves land on the same directory
// — which is the property that was actually broken.
