// What the supervisor does with an upgrade it cannot complete: nothing.
//
// The order used to be kill the working deck → attempt → fail → rebuild the
// deck. bin/deck.js exited 76 first, and only then did bin/agent-dag.js spawn
// npx and find out the fetch was impossible. So a failed update cost a real
// interruption every time — the SSE stream dropped, hook events fired into the
// gap were lost outright (hook/hook.js is fire-and-forget, 1s timeout, no
// retry), the canvas came back with tools stuck in flight — and it was paid in
// full even when the update never had a chance of working. Reported from an
// unattended terminal as the same version, the same ETARGET and the same
// teardown four times over.
//
// The rule is an ordering between two processes, so it can only be observed by
// running them. This builds the install layout npx produces in a temp
// directory, runs the SHIPPED bin/agent-dag.js inside it, and gives it a
// two-line worker that asks for an upgrade and then reports whether it is still
// alive. The technique — build a real install layout in a temp directory and
// run the shipped bin unmodified inside it — is this repo's usual one.
//
// The two npx entry points are the only things stubbed, by shadowing them in a
// sandbox copy of src/server/npx.mjs: no npx runs, nothing is installed and
// nothing is downloaded. Everything else — the decision, the note, the reply,
// the handover — is the code that ships.
