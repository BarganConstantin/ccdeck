// What the supervisor does with a dead worker, and specifically what it does
// with one that died in the same instant the user pressed Ctrl+C.
//
// The deck asks to be restarted by exiting 75 (or 76, "come back through npx").
// The supervisor used to act on that code before checking whether it was still
// supposed to be running at all, so a Ctrl+C landing on a worker that was
// already mid-restart got a fresh deck spawned on top of it: the terminal
// printed `restarted → vX · http://…` after the stop, and the new worker served
// until the signal handler's 2.5s retry timer happened to kill it. The 76
// variant started a full npx registry fetch first.
//
// Ctrl+C is the input here, and it reaches this process on every platform —
// POSIX delivers it to the foreground process group, Windows raises
// CTRL_C_EVENT for the whole console — so `stopping` is a parameter and both
// answers are asserted.
//
// The second half of the file is the other way a worker can end — not with an
// exit code at all, but killed by a signal — and what the supervisor owes its
// caller then.
