// on the other end. The same goes for the eight TOOL_CATEGORY rows: a key whose
// value is the default answers exactly what no key answers.

// dropping an `export` keyword and dropping the declaration look identical in a
// diff read too quickly, and the second one silently removes a branch.
//
// Plain node throughout: the assertions are module namespaces, source text and
// pure functions, and nothing here renders.
