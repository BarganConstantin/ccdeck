// #357: reduced motion stopped at the canvas edge, and two transitions were
// written from JS where no rule in the sheet could ever reach them.
//
// #260 built the canvas half of the contract and canvas-motion.test.ts polices
// it, but that sweep is deliberately fenced to selectors matching its CANVAS
// regex. Outside the fence four panel readouts went on easing a LAYOUT property
// — `.qb-fill` and `.ctx-window-fill` on width, `.qb-pace-marker` on left,
// `.uh-bar` on height — each of them driven by a number that changes on its own
// schedule, so a reader who asked the OS for less motion watched bars slide and
// a marker walk sideways at moments they neither chose nor could predict. The
// tool modal arrived on `popIn`, which lifts it 4px and scales it up.
//
// Worse, `src/web/App.tsx` set `transition: "opacity 500ms ease, stroke-width
// 200ms ease"` on every session edge and `ContextModal.tsx` set `transition:
// "stroke-dasharray 400ms ease"` on the donut arc, both as INLINE styles. An
// inline style outranks every selector, so no `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
// reduce)` block could answer either one without `!important`: the contract was
// unenforceable there by construction. Both now name a custom property that
// styles.css owns and the media query rewrites.
//
// So this file is the sweep canvas-motion.test.ts stops at, widened to the
// whole sheet and continued into the components:
//
//   1. every rule that eases a layout property is answered under reduced
//      motion by a rule of the same selector, placed later so it wins the tie
//      (a media query adds no specificity);
//   2. every rule whose animation runs keyframes that MOVE the element is
//      answered the same way — derived from the keyframes rather than from a
//      list of selectors, so the `pulse` dots stay out on the merits (pulse
//      animates opacity and nothing else, and a fade is the recommended
//      reduced-motion fallback rather than the thing being escaped) and any
//      dot that ever starts moving is caught rather than grandfathered;
//   3. nothing sets motion from JS without an escape hatch the sheet controls.
//
// There is no jsdom here and React cannot be rendered, so the sources are the
// evidence. Everything below re-derives its own parser rather than importing
// one: a test that borrowed another test's collector would go green whenever
// that one was loosened.
