// #395: a finished Codex session read as live for ninety minutes.
//
// Codex writes no Stop and no SessionEnd, so the ONLY thing that ever settled a
// Codex root was `sweepStaleSessions` — the ninety-minute silence reaper #350
// built for terminals that were killed. A turn that ended cleanly at 10:00 kept
// its inflight treatment, kept counting toward the topbar's running total and
// kept the favicon saying "running" until 11:30, at which point it flipped to
// done with a backdated `endedAt` and `reaped = true`, the flag that means the
// sweep GUESSED. It had not guessed. The session finished and the deck was told:
// `event_msg/task_complete` was sitting in the rollout, and `codexObjToPayload`
// dropped it on the floor with everything else it did not recognise.
//
// What the rollouts actually say, sampled across the eight files under this
// machine's CODEX_HOME (structural names only):
//
//    55  event_msg/task_started      one per turn, both CLI versions
//    54  event_msg/task_complete     the turn finished
//     1  event_msg/turn_aborted      the turn was interrupted (Esc)
//
// 54 + 1 = 55: every started turn ends with exactly one of the two, so the pair
// is exhaustive and both map to `Stop`. Per TURN, not per session — which is the
// same shape Claude has, where the Stop hook fires at the end of every turn and
// the next `UserPromptSubmit` reopens the root.
//
// The catch this file exists to pin: the prompt event that reopens a Codex root
// was RENAMED between CLI versions. 0.144 writes `event_msg/user_message`; 0.147
// writes `event_msg/item_completed` carrying a `UserMessage` item and no
// `user_message` at all. Mapping only the old name would have traded "live
// forever" for "done forever" on current Codex — a session settling at the end
// of turn one and never coming back. Both names are mapped, and both are driven
// here.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the real translation function and
// the real reducer, with the object shapes copied from real rollout lines.
