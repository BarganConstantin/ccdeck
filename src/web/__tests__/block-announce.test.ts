// #372: the deck announced the one thing a screen reader should never hear and
// stayed silent on the one thing it should.
//
// The topbar's stat strip was `<span className="status" role="status">` wrapped
// around, among other numbers, `stateRef.current.totalEvents` — which
// reducer.ts increments once per hook event, so on a fan-out it moves tens of
// times a second. `role="status"` is `aria-live="polite"`, so every one of those
// increments queued an utterance; and — the half the issue got wrong in the
// direction of understating it — `role="status"` also carries an implicit
// `aria-atomic="true"` (ARIA 1.2), so the utterance was not the bare "1433" the
// report describes but the WHOLE strip re-read, "live 4 sessions 14 agents 1433
// events 4.21M tokens mcp $1164 cost", once per event. Either way it is
// continuous speech about nothing, which is how a page teaches its user to
// switch the screen reader off.
//
// The sessions, agents and events counters in that utterance were later removed
// from the strip outright. `totalEvents` still exists — reducer.ts increments it
// and group 4 below folds it through a real tool storm — it is simply no longer
// drawn. Nothing about the rule changes: what is left in the row still moves on
// its own, which is why the role stays off.
//
// The same deck said nothing at all when a session stopped on a permission
// prompt. That fact reached `document.title`, the favicon, the amber
// `.waiting-stat` chip and the card's own waiting row, and all four of those are
// things you have to look at.
//
// Three groups of cases here, and they are deliberately not restatements of one
// another:
//
//   1. the wording and the quietness, called directly as the pure functions the
//      app runs;
//   2. the wiring, read out of App.tsx as text, because a correct decision that
//      is never rendered into a live region is not a fix;
//   3. a transcript, folded over the REAL reducer — real hook payloads, real
//      `blockedSessions()`, real announcement functions — so the whole path from
//      "CC sent a Notification" to "a screen reader says a sentence" is pinned
//      end to end, and so is the path from "fifty tool events arrived" to
//      "nothing was said".
//
// Plain node, no jsdom, React cannot be rendered — which is the reason the
// decision lives in block-announce.ts at all, and the reason group 3 exists: it
// is the closest this suite can get to listening to the page.
