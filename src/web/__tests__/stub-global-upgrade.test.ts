// `npm i -g ccdeck` booted, and then could never update itself.
//
// #340 REMOVED the stub: ccdeck is now this tarball republished under a third
// name, the way agent-dag always was, so a fresh `npm i -g ccdeck` installs the
// deck directly with nothing nested inside it. This file stays, and so does
// every layout case in it, because the nested shape does not disappear from the
// world when it stops being published — it is sitting on the disk of everyone
// who installed ccdeck before this change, and the code under test is the code
// that gets them their first upgrade off it. The cases that read the stub's own
// files are gone; the ones that pin what the DECK does when it finds itself in
// that layout are the ones that matter now.
//
// #351 fixed the half everybody saw: the stub ships nothing but bin/, and it
// walked one way — `../../agents-deck` — which is right under npx and wrong
// under a global install, because npm stopped hoisting a global package's
// dependencies in v7. Teaching it the nested layout made the deck start.
//
// Nothing downstream learned about that layout. Every self-update surface went
// on naming `agents-deck`, which under the stub layout is a DIFFERENT
// directory: the process runs out of
// `<prefix>/lib/node_modules/ccdeck/node_modules/agents-deck` while
// `npm i -g agents-deck@latest` writes `<prefix>/lib/node_modules/agents-deck`
// — a tree it never reads, and one a `npm i -g ccdeck` user does not otherwise
// have. So the button installed a second unrelated copy, installedVersion never
// moved, the restart notice never came, and the same update was offered forever
// while the upgrade reported "done". The printed command underneath it was the
// same wrong line, so the manual escape hatch pointed at the same wrong tree.
//
// This file pins the name each install shape resolves to, and pins it at the
// two places it becomes an action: the command the user is shown, and the argv
// npm is actually spawned with. The layouts are built on disk the way
// stub-global-layout.test.ts builds them — nothing is installed, nothing is
// downloaded, and npm is a recording fake that never runs.
