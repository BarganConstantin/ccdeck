// #399: Codex is the only provider that reports its context window exactly, and
// it was the only one with no context readout at all.
//
// `ContextObserved` had one emitter, `maybeResolveContext`, and a provider gate
// routed Codex past it — belt and braces, since that function also early-returns
// without `transcript_path`, a field Codex never sends. So `agent.context` was
// permanently undefined for a Codex session, `currentContextTokens` was 0, and
// the donut's own gate (`kind === "root" && currentContextTokens > 0`) never
// opened. The donut's onClick is the only caller of `setContextFor`, so the
// whole ContextModal had no entry point for a Codex user: not an empty modal, no
// way to open one. The `contextWindow` the reducer had been stamping on the root
// since #171 had exactly two readers, the donut and that modal, and both sat
// behind the closed gate — write-only state.
//
// WHAT THE ROLLOUTS ACTUALLY SAY. Sampled every rollout under this machine's
// CODEX_HOME (structural names, keys and numbers only, never record content):
// 8 files, 5 on Codex 0.144.5 and 3 on 0.147.0.
//
//    58  event_msg/task_started   every one carrying a numeric
//                                 model_context_window — #395's claim holds
//   178  event_msg/token_count    every one carrying info.last_token_usage,
//                                 info.total_token_usage AND
//                                 info.model_context_window
//   164  of those on 0.144.5, whose usage blocks have five keys
//    14  of those on 0.147.0, which adds cache_write_input_tokens
//
// So the window is on 236 records and the deck read it off 58 of them; the
// occupancy is on 178 and the deck read it off none. Both numbers were already
// parsed and thrown away.
//
// WHICH FIELD IS THE OCCUPANCY. `total_token_usage` is cumulative SPEND — it
// re-counts the cached prefix every turn and reaches 5,238,700 against a 258,400
// window inside one session here, so it cannot be an occupancy. `last_token_usage`
// is the most recent request: `input_tokens` is the whole conversation Codex
// sent (it already contains the cached prefix) and `total_tokens` is that plus
// the completion — exactly input + output on 177 of the 178 records.
//
// The 178th is the interesting one and it decides the field. It sits immediately
// before a `thread_rolled_back` record — the user rewinding the conversation —
// and its per-request components are all zero while `last_token_usage.total_tokens`
// reads 47,355, down from 58,516, with `total_token_usage` unchanged because no
// request was made. Codex is restating the recomputed size of the context there.
// Reading `input_tokens` would have collapsed the donut to 0% at the one moment
// the number moved most, so `total_tokens` is what the deck reads.
//
// IS THE WINDOW "LIVE"? Not in the sense of changing: 258,400 on all 236 records
// across both CLI versions, both models seen (gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.6-luna) and all
// 8 files, and it changed mid-session in zero of them. It is live in the sense
// that matters — it is the CLI's own ceiling rather than the deck's guess, and
// the static table answers 1,050,000 for the same model. That is the 4x error
// the donut would draw with if this were dropped.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the real translation function,
// the real reducer, the real scanners and the real copy rule, with the object
// shapes copied from real rollout lines.
