// #346: the badge from #337 works, and the alarm surfaces were being lit by the
// kind of block that is not an alarm — which is also the kind that fires most.
// Counted from one machine's events.jsonl, deduplicated across the decks that
// share it: 16 idle_prompt against 5 permission_prompt. So three quarters of
// everything the topbar chip, the tab title and the favicon reported was a
// session that had simply finished its turn and not been picked back up, on a
// node already reading `done` two columns away. Those three surfaces are worth
// having only while they are rare.
//
// The two kinds were already separate where it mattered least (sort order,
// styling) and identical where it mattered most (every place that counts). This
// pins the split at the counting, and it pins what idle KEEPS: its row, its card
// line, its place above running in the sort, and CC's verbatim sentence in the
// tooltip. Only the alarm goes.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the shapes App.tsx and
// SessionList.tsx build their rows from, and calls the shipped rules on them
// directly.
//
// #377: the alarm predicate was re-derived here rather than imported, because
// until then it existed only inline inside a React component that bare node
// cannot render. That is also why ambient-signal.test.ts kept its own copy, and
// why that copy silently went stale. The rule now lives in ambient-counts.ts,
// so both suites call the same function the app calls and neither can drift
// from it; the source-text checks below shrank to the one thing text is
// actually good for, which is proving the call sites did not quietly grow a
// second definition beside it.
