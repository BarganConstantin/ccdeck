// #353: the tinted session box eased four layout properties that the camera
// rewrote on every frame, so it rubber-banded behind its own nodes.
//
// `.cluster-card` transitions `left`, `top`, `width` and `height` over 320ms,
// and SessionClusters wrote all four as `c.x * zoom + x` and friends — the
// cluster's layout coordinate with the viewport folded into it. React Flow
// carries the real nodes with ONE transform on `.react-flow__viewport`, eased by
// nothing, so a pan moved the nodes instantly and put the box through a third of
// a second of easing to catch up. Measured on a live deck against the target the
// component itself wrote that frame: 94px behind on a twelve-move pan, and on a
// pinch zoom 693px of `left`, 1161px of `top`, 1014px of `width` and 1167px of
// `height` — the box detached from the nodes it is drawn around by 674px. A
// session drag was 76px behind for 31 frames of 71.
//
// The fix is NOT to delete the four. They are the only thing keeping the box
// with its cards when the LAYOUT changes: SessionClusters reads each node's
// final position out of the store the frame the layout changes, while the nodes
// are still easing their own transform over the 320ms `.react-flow__node` gives
// them, so a box with no easing would snap to the new bounding box a third of a
// second AHEAD of the cards inside it. One desync traded for another.
//
// What changed is where the camera lives. `.session-clusters` now carries it as
// a single transform, exactly as `.react-flow__viewport` does, and everything
// underneath is written in layout coordinates. The four eased properties then
// change when — and only when — the layout changes, which is what they were
// written for, and the camera reaches them through a property that eases
// nothing. Post-fix the same measurement reads 0.0px on all four for every
// frame of a pan, a zoom and a session drag.
//
// The second half of the issue is the escape hatch that never fired.
// `.cluster-card.dragging` existed to drop the easing during a drag, and the
// component renders `className="cluster-card"` as a literal string, so the class
// was added by nobody and the rule was dead. Confirmed live: every card reports
// `"cluster-card"` on every frame of a session drag. The answer hangs off
// `.canvas-wrap.dragging-any` instead — the flag App already sets for every
// gesture, and the one the nodes above are already answered by.
//
// There is no jsdom here and no layout engine, so none of the pixel numbers
// above can be re-measured. What this file does instead is pin the two SOURCES
// that produced them: the stylesheet rules, and the geometry the component
// writes into the inline style. Both are read with a parser of this file's own —
// borrowing another suite's collector would go green the moment that one was
// loosened.
