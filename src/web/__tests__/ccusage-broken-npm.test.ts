// A Windows machine whose npm.cmd / npx.cmd shims are broken — `%~dp0` resolved
// to the user's home root, so both shims launch and Node then cannot load the
// script they point at (#432). Two things went wrong that are ours.
//
// The modal said "ccusage could not report usage — try again". npxMissing, the
// one place a missing npx turns into an actionable sentence, tests for four
// spellings of "the shell could not find it" and this is a fifth shape: the
// shim WAS found, and `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` is not `not found` — the underscore is
// not a space. So it fell through to the reason map, and trying again is the
// one thing that cannot work while npm is broken on disk.
//
// And both failures were handed to console.error carrying a subprocess's entire
// stderr, which is a fifteen-line Node stack trace. The deck repaints its pulse
// line every 800ms with a bare `\r` (see term.mjs), so that dump landed over
// its own boot report — and primeCcusage runs at boot, so on such a machine it
// was the first thing on screen.
//
// These pin the fifth sentence, the four older ones that must not lose theirs,
// the one-line rule for anything written while the deck is painting, and the
// one failure in ccusage.mjs that really was permanent: a managed install that
// resolves but cannot run, which nothing ever re-checked.
