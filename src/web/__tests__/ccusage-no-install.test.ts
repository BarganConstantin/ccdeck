// AGENTS_DECK_NO_INSTALL=1 is documented as "never install or update
// claude-swap / ccusage, and never ask npm about releases", but only the
// startup priming in bin/deck.js honoured it. Opening the usage-history modal
// called /api/ccusage → fetchCcusageDaily → getRunner, which on a machine with
// no managed install ran `npm install ccusage@latest` (or `npx -y
// ccusage@latest`) — a registry download the user had explicitly forbidden —
// and, when ccusage was already installed, still ran `npm view ccusage
// version` plus a background upgrade. These tests pin all three refusals.
