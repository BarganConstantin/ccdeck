// #350: a permission block on a session whose terminal died stood forever, and
// since #348 a `permission` block is exactly what lights the topbar chip, the
// tab title and the favicon. The card and the sidebar row print the block's own
// age beside it, so a stale one there reads as stale; the title carries a bare
// count and the favicon is a coloured dot, and neither can say how old it is. A
// killed session holding those two is the failure #348 was built to avoid — a
// signal rare enough to be trusted, reporting something untrue.
//
// Nothing reaped it. `sweepStaleTools` finalises ToolCalls and never looks
// above them, `pruneOldAgents` wants `state === "done"` and `pruneDoneSessions`
// wants a session with nothing live in it — and this session is `active`,
// because a permission prompt arrives mid-turn and the event that would have
// ended that turn is the one that never came.
//
// The fix is the staleness underneath rather than a TTL bolted onto `waiting`:
// the stale block and the stale `active` beside it are one bug. `sweepStaleSessions`
// settles the session, and the block goes with it — so #348's counters, which
// read `kind` off the block, fall to zero without knowing anything about this.
//
// THE CLOCK IS THE LAST EVENT, NEVER THE BLOCK'S OWN `since`. Those are
// different numbers: `since` is when the prompt arrived, and a human can take an
// hour to answer one. A threshold measured against `since` would cancel real
// blocks; measured against the last event, a session that is still being heard
// from is never touched however long it has been blocked. The first describe
// below is that property, and it is the one that stops this fix from being worse
// than the bug.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the reducer directly and
// re-derives #348's alarm counters from the same shape App.tsx builds them from.
