// #434: the skip link's focus ring, firing for a mouse arrival.
//
// #381 gave <main> `tabIndex={-1}` so the skip link would have somewhere to
// land, and gave `.canvas-wrap:focus-visible` an inset ring so the reader could
// see they had landed. `tabindex="-1"` grants a second thing nobody asked for:
// an element the MOUSE can focus. So a click on empty canvas parked focus on
// the canvas silently — `:focus-visible` does not match a pointer arrival, so
// nothing was drawn — and then the next keystroke made the browser change its
// answer for the element that was ALREADY focused, and a 2px accent rectangle
// the width of the window lit up on a press the user reads as re-layout or a
// theme swap, and stayed until focus moved.
//
// Measured in Chrome, on a standalone page with the same two rules and then in
// the deck itself. Same element throughout, focus never changing:
//
//   click empty <main tabindex="-1">   :focus true   :focus-visible FALSE
//   then press any key at all          :focus true   :focus-visible TRUE
//
// "Any key at all" is the correction this file records against the issue, which
// listed the deck's own single-letter shortcuts. `x` — a key the deck has no
// shortcut for and never claims — lights the ring exactly the same, because the
// flip is the user agent's and happens before any handler of ours runs. So does
// a right-click, which also focuses <main>.
//
// The fix could not be CSS, and that is worth writing down because CSS is where
// a focus ring belongs. `:focus-visible` is the user agent's own judgement and
// Selectors 4 lets it be re-made AFTER focus has landed, so no selector can
// separate the two arrivals: whatever marks the skip link's arrival, the
// pointer's arrival still matches `:focus-visible` one keystroke later and the
// GLOBAL ring rule still applies to it. CSS could only overrule the ring with
// `outline: none`, and #368 pins the sheet to exactly one of those, for the
// reason that issue exists — a rule that quietly removes a focus ring is how
// the search field lost its own. Dropping the ring outright fails #381's
// purpose. What was left was to take away the arrival: a mouse press that would
// land focus on the canvas itself no longer does, so the ring keeps its one
// caller, the programmatic focus it was written for.
//
// Plain node, no DOM and no renderer — a real mousedown cannot be dispatched
// here — so the wiring is read as text from components/CanvasMain.tsx (the
// <main> element, since it left App.tsx's markup), canvas-pointer-focus.ts
// (the handler and its list, since they left App.tsx) and styles.css, the way
// manage-block.test.ts and landmark-outline.test.ts do. The handler itself is
// also called, on a stand-in for the event. Comments are stripped before any
// "appears nowhere" assertion, because the prose above the code in this repo
// quotes the shapes it rejected and a search for a rejected shape would
// otherwise find the sentence rejecting it.
