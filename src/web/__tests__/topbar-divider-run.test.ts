// The topbar's readout strip draws its dividers with `::before` rules keyed on
// ADJACENT elements, and the row is conditional — three of its four members can
// be absent, and the fourth renders under either of two class names. That
// combination has already failed once. #502 removed the sessions, agents and
// events counters, and `.topbar .status .stat + .sysmeter-wrap::before` became a
// selector nothing could match in any state: the meter's preceding sibling was
// the events counter, and with the counters gone it is the status pill. Deleting
// only the markup would have left the row with its first line in the wrong place
// and two bare boundaries ahead of it. The rule was moved to the element AFTER
// the meter and the shape restored by inspection, with nothing pinning it.
//
// Removing the MCP legend asked the same question a second time within the hour
// — a `.stat` out of the MIDDLE of the run this time, which the rules survive,
// but only because of which side of the `+` each one names. That is exactly the
// kind of reasoning that should not have to be redone from scratch on the next
// removal, so it is a test now.
//
// This walks every row the strip can render, resolves the sheet's own divider
// rules against each one, and counts lines. No DOM: the rules come out of
// styles.css and the row shapes out of App.tsx's markup, the way dead-css and
// session-hue read the same two files.
