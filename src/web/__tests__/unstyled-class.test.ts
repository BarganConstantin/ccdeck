// The accounts panel's auto-switch button composed `ap-auto-state toggle${…}`,
// and no `.toggle` selector has ever existed in the stylesheet — the only two
// hits for the word there are English prose inside comments. Nothing queried it
// from the DOM either, so the token did nothing at all; and being a generic
// single-word name, it is exactly the kind a later rule could claim globally,
// at which point that button would silently pick up styling meant for something
// else. Its sibling switch, .ver-auto, shows the shape that holds: one name for
// the control, one modifier for its state, nothing a stranger would reach for.
//
// dead-css.test.ts could not have caught it. Its class half is a watchlist of
// names earlier issues retired, and "toggle" cannot join that list: the
// detector reads every quoted and backticked span in every .tsx, and this same
// panel says "this toggle takes over when you stop it" in a sentence on screen.
// One word, English in one place and markup in another. So this reads the other
// direction — class names out of the className attributes themselves, where
// prose cannot reach — and asks the stylesheet for a rule for each one.
