// The accounts panel's ↻ reloaded behind a poker face: no busy state, no
// completion signal, an empty catch and two `if (res.ok)` guards that dropped a
// refusal without a trace. A reload that failed looked exactly like one that
// came back with the same numbers, and the first load failing left "Checking…"
// on screen with no branch behind it — the panel's failure box renders inside
// the branch that needs a roster, so with no roster there was nowhere for the
// message to go.
//
// The rules for what a finished reload leaves on screen are pinned here, and
// the wiring that reaches them is read out of the component the way
// modal-dialog-role.test.ts reads its markup: the suite has no DOM, so the
// shape is what can be checked, and the shape is what the bug was.
