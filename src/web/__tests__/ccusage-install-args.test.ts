// file and its arguments with single spaces and no quoting, so on a profile like
// C:\Users\John Smith the command line read `--prefix C:\Users\John
// Smith\.agents-deck\ccusage`: npm took the prefix as C:\Users\John and the rest
// as a second package to install, exited non-zero, and the install never
// happened — every boot printed "install failed" and every usage-history modal
// fell back to the slow `npx -y ccusage@latest` path. These tests pin the
// command line the install gets on Windows and on POSIX.
