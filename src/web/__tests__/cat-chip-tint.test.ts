// One category, two visual identities (#383).
//
// A tool's bucket is drawn on two surfaces: the bubble on the canvas
// (`.tool-burst.cat-*`, which sets a `--cat-accent`) and the chip in the detail
// panel's activity strip (`.cat-chip.cat-*`, which tints its border). Both class
// names are composed at runtime — `cat-${c}` in App.tsx and ToolBursts.tsx — so
// `unstyled-class.test.ts` deliberately leaves the whole `cat-` prefix out of its
// sweep ("no DOM here can say what they became"), and nothing else asked whether
// the eight members of the union each had a rule.
//
// Seven did. `.cat-chip.cat-other` did not, while `.tool-burst.cat-other` did, so
// the one bucket EVERY unknown tool lands in — `categoryFor` returns "other" for
// any name with no row — was tinted grey on the bubble and left on the default
// `--line` border on the chip.
//
// So this file does not assert that one selector exists. It reads the list of
// categories off the `ToolCategory` union in tool-taxonomy.ts and holds both
// families to it, which means a ninth member fails here until it is styled rather
// than shipping untinted on whichever surface was forgotten. And it checks the
// chip against the bubble's own accent rather than against a colour written down
// here, so the fix for a gap like this cannot be a colour that matches neither.
