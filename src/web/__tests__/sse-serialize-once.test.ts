// Every ingested event used to be serialized twice: once to build the SSE
// frame and once more, from scratch, for the events.jsonl line — two full
// passes over payloads that reach megabytes, back to back on the event loop.
// The frame was also built unconditionally, so a deck running with no browser
// tab open (or replaying its log at boot, which happens before the listener
// even exists) paid for a string nobody would ever read.
//
// These pin the two halves: nothing is serialized when there is neither a
// subscriber nor a persistence file, and when there is, the envelope is
// serialized exactly once no matter how many consumers share it.
