// WORDMARK_WIDTH is a hand-computed prediction of how wide the drawn ccdeck
// mark is, and it is the ONLY thing standing between the art and a terminal too
// narrow to hold it: `wordmark()` renders the three rows when
// `columns >= WORDMARK_WIDTH + 1` and falls back to the one-line compact form
// otherwise. Nothing in that path ever measures the art, so the two can
// disagree silently — and the existing coverage cannot catch it, because
// term-layout.test.ts asserts the gate with WORDMARK_WIDTH on BOTH sides
// (`wordmark({ columns: WORDMARK_WIDTH - 1 }).kind === "compact"`), which holds
// for any value the constant might take, right or wrong.
//
// The failure that hides behind that is not subtle once it happens: an
// under-counting width lets the art through at a width it does not fit, and
// three rows of half-blocks wrap into six broken ones on the first screen a
// user ever sees. WORDMARK_LINES is exported for exactly this comparison, which
// is why #383 kept the export rather than removing it as unused surface.
//
// Plain node: wordmark.mjs draws with string arithmetic and never touches a DOM.
