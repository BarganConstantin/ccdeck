// Four motion defects that only the stylesheet can be asked about — there is no
// jsdom here, so nothing rendered can be observed and the rules themselves are
// the evidence.
//
// #259: .tool-burst-wrap eased `top` and not `left`. ToolBursts rewrites both
// from the viewport on every pan and zoom frame, and the SVG leader line to the
// same bubble is redrawn from those coordinates with no easing at all, so the
// pill trailed its own connector down the screen for 220ms of every vertical
// move — and equally for the sibling index shift the easing was added for. Both
// axes are transitioned together or neither is; the connector cannot ease, so
// it is neither.
//
// #260: every reduced-motion block in the sheet covered the accounts panel, the
// success mark or the relayout easing. The canvas — spinning orbits, marching
// dashes, wobbling emoji, a bubble flying out of an agent per tool call — was
// untouched. The sweep below holds the whole canvas to it: any rule there that
// animates, or that eases a property which moves the element, must be answered
// by a rule of the same selector inside a prefers-reduced-motion block, placed
// later so it wins the tie. Coverage is matched on the exact selector because
// a media query adds no specificity: `.tool-burst { animation: none }` does not
// reach `.tool-burst.status-done`.
//
// #266: the hover lift on a clickable bubble was dead. bubble-spawn runs with
// `both` and so keeps filling its 100% transform for the element's whole life,
// and animation declarations outrank author rules while they fill. The lift is
// the independent `translate` property now, which composes with the animated
// transform instead of losing to it.
//
// #267: the press convention this codebase invented — scale(0.97), neutralised
// under reduced motion — was on four controls and missing from nine more.
//
// #355: fifteen further controls declared `cursor: pointer` and had no `:active`
// rule of any kind, so a press on the session row, a tool bubble, the context
// donut or the Restart button was indistinguishable from a hover. The
// enumeration below is no longer a snapshot of what happened to exist when it
// was written: the sweep at the end holds it against every `cursor: pointer`
// rule in the sheet, so the next pressable control either joins the convention
// or is written down as an exception.
//
// #356: one job, several answers, twice over. Nine rules run the `pulse`
// keyframes and five of them paint --inflight and mean "this is running right
// now" — they beat at 1.2s, 1.1s and 1.4s across two easings. And three centred
// dialogs over a dimmed backdrop are reached from this canvas through one
// useModalDismiss, of which one arrived on fadeIn + popIn and two were simply
// present on the next frame. Both families are swept at the bottom of this file,
// each derived from something the sheet says about itself rather than from a
// list: the pulses by the colour token they paint, the dialogs by the shape they
// are laid out in.
//
// Deliberately outside the canvas sweep: the topbar, banners and sidebar, whose
// single status dots pulse opacity in a fixed strip rather than across the
// surface the deck is watched on, and .cat-filter-bar, chrome that floats over
// the canvas rather than living in it. Its button's press is checked below with
// the other controls.
