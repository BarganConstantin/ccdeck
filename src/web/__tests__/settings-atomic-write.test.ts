// Reported: the hook installer replaced ~/.claude/settings.json with a bare
// writeFile, and did it on every launch even when the entries it wanted were
// already there and identical. Two ways that loses data: a crash or power cut
// between truncate and flush leaves a half-written settings.json, and any change
// another process makes to the file between our read and our write is silently
// discarded. These tests pin the two halves of the fix — the replacement is a
// same-directory temp file renamed over the target, and a launch that would
// produce identical bytes writes nothing at all.
