// Reported: the single-writer election ended the duplicated events.jsonl lines
// for everything the hook delivers, and left the Codex rollout watcher writing
// its own copy from every deck. That watcher builds its events inside the server
// — it tails ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl and never sees a hook — so
// with N decks up, each Codex session start, prompt and tool call was appended
// to the one events.jsonl they share N times: the log grew and rotated N times
// as fast, and every replay of it on boot ingested each tool call N times. On
// Windows, where Codex hooks never fire, the rollout is the only Codex capture
// path there is, so the duplication was the whole of it.
//
// The decks now run the same election over the same discovery records for the
// rollouts they tail. These pin both halves: the rule itself — which must agree
// with the hook's copy of it, and must cover exactly the decks that read the
// same file — and a running deck that draws a rollout it was not elected to log.
