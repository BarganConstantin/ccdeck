// #433. The deck's own failure box has told people to "put ccusage on PATH
// yourself" for as long as that sentence has existed, and nothing in the deck
// had ever looked at PATH for ccusage. getRunner knew two runners — the managed
// install under ~/.agents-deck/ccusage, and `npx -y ccusage@latest` — and
// resolveEntry read one directory. So a reader who did exactly what the box
// said, and could prove it with `ccusage --version` in their own shell, got the
// identical box on the next click.
//
// Two ways to close that: look at PATH, or stop promising it. Looking is what
// happened, because there is a documented configuration that has no other
// answer at all. `AGENTS_DECK_NO_INSTALL=1` means "never install or update
// claude-swap / ccusage"; somebody who sets it AND installs ccusage themselves
// has done the only thing that flag can sensibly mean, and the deck answered
// "ccusage is not installed" while it was installed and on their PATH. There
// was no combination of settings that made a self-managed ccusage work. The
// #432 machine — npm and npx both unusable — is the same story with the volume
// up: it cannot create the managed install and cannot run the fallback, so a
// copy the user already has is the only route left.
//
// These pin the four things that has to mean: the order runners are tried in,
// that PATH is genuinely consulted on all three platforms (which on Windows
// means PATHEXT and a full path, never a bare `ccusage.cmd` — see #456), that an
// explicit AGENTS_DECK_CCUSAGE is obeyed and its failures named as its own, and
// that the sentence in the box is now true.
