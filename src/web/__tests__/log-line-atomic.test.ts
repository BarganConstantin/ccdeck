// Reported: events.jsonl was shredded whenever one event went over 512 KiB.
//
// `fsPromises.appendFile` is not one write(2) — Node's writeFileHandle loops
// over the payload in 512 KiB chunks, awaiting each one — so any line past
// 524288 bytes reached the file as two or more separate appends with the event
// loop free in between. pushEvent fires the append without awaiting it and then
// synchronously kicks off the transcript scanners, each of which pushes its own
// event a moment later, so an ordinary small event landed INSIDE a large tool
// response: the big line was torn into two unparseable halves and the small one
// was swallowed inside one of them. Two decks sharing one events.jsonl — the
// default, and something the single-writer election deliberately allows for
// different sessions — made it cross-process as well, where no amount of
// in-process queueing would have helped.
//
// The damage was invisible: replayLog skipped every line it could not parse and
// said nothing, so after a restart the canvas was missing the largest tool
// responses and whatever event was spliced into them, with no counter anywhere.
//
// These pin every part of the fix: one whole line per write(2), proved both on
// the writer itself and end to end through a running deck's ingest route,
// proved across two processes as well as inside one, the order lines land in,
// and a log that is ALREADY shredded on a user's disk still replaying
// everything around the damage — now with the skip counted and reported rather
// than swallowed.
