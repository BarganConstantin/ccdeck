// #354: three defects in the motion of the element the deck draws most — a
// live deck was sampled with 79 tool bubbles on screen at once — all three in
// one block of styles.css, and all three invisible to a test that only reads
// durations off the sheet. What each of them needed was a statement about the
// MECHANISM, so the sweeps below are written against mechanisms rather than
// against the seven literal declarations that happened to be wrong.
//
// There is no jsdom here and no layout engine, so nothing rendered can be
// observed. The sheet and ToolBursts.tsx are the evidence. Every parser below
// is re-derived rather than imported from another test file: a test that
// borrowed another one's collector would go green the moment that one was
// loosened. Comments are stripped before anything is read, because the comments
// in this sheet quote the declarations they explain — several of them now quote
// the exact `ease-in` and the exact `460ms` that the assertions here say appear
// nowhere.
//
// 1. THE FLASH FIRED FROM THE WRONG CLOCK.
//    `.tool-burst.status-done` read `bubble-spawn 460ms …, bubble-done-flash
//    520ms 460ms ease-out`, under a comment claiming "spawn THEN flash … so
//    neither interrupts the other". That is true only if the list starts when
//    the bubble does. It does not. `bubble-spawn` is named at the same list
//    index on the base rule and on the status rule, so it survives the class
//    change untouched; `bubble-done-flash` is NEW to the list at that moment,
//    so it starts THEN and measures its delay from the class change — which is
//    the tool finishing, at an arbitrary time. Measured through a real deck at
//    127.0.0.1:4409 on a Bash call: the tool settled at timeline 5356ms, the ✓'s
//    own `mark-pop` started one frame later at 5373 with no delay, and the flash
//    did not paint until 5833. One event, two signals, 460ms apart — 680ms on
//    the sub-bubble, whose delay had been SUMMED with its spawn delay in the
//    belief that the list restarts, which made a sub's glow trail its primary's
//    by 220ms on a tool that finished once.
//    So the rule swept below is the mechanism: an animation that first appears
//    when a class is added begins at the class change, therefore it may not
//    carry a delay.
//
// 2. THE ENTRANCE BOUNCED TWICE.
//    `animation-timing-function` on the shorthand is not the curve of the
//    animation, it is the default curve of every SEGMENT of it. `bubble-spawn`
//    had three keyframes and overrode nothing, so cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56,
//    0.64, 1) — which peaks at progress 1.0978 — was applied to both segments.
//    `getKeyframes()` on a live bubble returned it attached to offsets 0, 0.55
//    AND 1, and the measured scale path was 0.35 → 1.1948 at 140ms → 1.1201 at
//    250ms → a trough of 0.9883 at 370ms → 1.00: an arrival that ends by
//    shrinking below its own size. The sweep below counts, per animation, how
//    many segments an overshooting curve governs.
//
// 3. THE EXIT WAS THE ONLY `ease-in` IN THE SHEET.
//    Every other timing function here decelerates into rest — all seven
//    distinct cubic-bezier() curves in the sheet put their second control point
//    at x < 1, so the curve flattens as it lands. `ease-in` is
//    cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1, 1): its second control point sits ON the endpoint,
//    so it leaves rest at zero speed and arrives at full speed, which is the
//    hang the report describes. Measured pre-fix, 150ms into the 600ms exit the
//    bubble was still at opacity 0.907 while the SVG leader line pointing at it
//    — whose opacity ToolBursts computes in JS as a dead-linear `1 - since /
//    FADE_MS` over the same 600ms — had already given up a quarter of its own.
//    The bubble was outliving its own connector, which is the exact desync
//    .tool-burst-wrap was fixed for in #259.
//    Worth recording because the report proposed it: the fix it suggested,
//    cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1), is `ease-in` with x1 nudged by 0.02. Measured
//    side by side in Chrome at 150ms of 600ms it gives 0.9014 against ease-in's
//    0.9065 — it would have changed the declaration and not the defect. The
//    curve is split off from the fade instead, for the reason .confetti-bit
//    already writes out in this sheet: one timing function governs every
//    property in a keyframe set, so movement keeps an ease-out and the fade runs
//    linear on its own clock, which is the connector's clock.
//
// NOT swept here, and left to the issues that own them: #355 (fourteen controls
// with no press feedback), #356 (four live-pulse rates and three modal
// entrances) and #379 (the duration/easing token scale). The literal durations
// asserted below are literals on purpose — when #379 lands they become token
// lookups, and this file should be updated rather than worked around.
