// bounded — and since the usage panel polls the endpoint every 60s against a
// 60s cache, the spike came back on nearly every poll. Opening every file at
// once also risked EMFILE, which readTokenSeries turns into a silent
// undercount. These tests pin the two caps and the line stitching the chunked
// reader needs to get right.
