// #480: `--version`, and the tokens the parser used to swallow.
//
// Two bugs from one loop with no `else`. `ccdeck --version` fell through to a
// full boot — a deck, a bound port, a browser, and a process that never exits —
// so the number had to be dug out of `npm ls -g` instead. And a mistyped flag
// was indistinguishable from a working one: `ccdeck --prot 4500` bound 4317 and
// said nothing, in a tool whose whole boot output exists so that nothing it did
// is a surprise.
//
// The risky half of the fix is the second one, and it is risky in exactly one
// place: `--port`, `--workspace` and `--history` take a value, consumed with
// `args[++i]`. If that value were ever re-examined as a token of its own, every
// correct `--port 4500` would report `4500` as an unknown option — a warning
// that fires on the right command line is the warning everyone learns to
// ignore. So the values are asserted, including values that look like paths on
// the other operating system.
//
// TWO ASSERTIONS IN HERE WERE LATER FOUND TO BE PINNING A BUG, and they are the
// two that said a value which is ITSELF A FLAG is still a value: `--workspace
// --scope` set the workspace to "--scope", and a trailing `--workspace` set it
// to `undefined`. #697 is what that costs — `ccdeck --workspace $PROJ
// --no-persist` with `PROJ` unset scoped a deck to a directory named
// `--no-persist` and persisted to the shared log anyway, with nothing in
// `unknown` because the token that belonged there had been eaten. Those two
// cases now go to `incomplete` and are asserted in argv-value-flags-697.test.ts.
// Everything else in this file is unchanged, deliberately: the warning must
// still never fire on a correct command line, and that is what the rest of it
// is for.
//
// The "nothing moved" half is a sweep, not a sample: the token list is read out
// of the parser's own source and checked against the table below, so a flag
// added or renamed later without a row here fails rather than quietly stops
// being covered.
//
// PLAIN NODE. parseArgs is strings in, a plain object out — no DOM, no React,
// no filesystem. The one spawn at the bottom runs the real bin/deck.js, which
// is the only way to prove `--version` exits instead of serving. No path
// assumptions anywhere: every path is derived from import.meta.url, and the
// path-shaped VALUES are opaque strings the parser never interprets.
