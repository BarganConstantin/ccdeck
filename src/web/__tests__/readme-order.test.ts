// What the README's first screen spends itself on (#440), and where the hero
// image lives (#439).
//
// The prose was never the problem. `--workspace` explaining that every matching
// deck draws the session while the log still gets one copy, the WARNING on share
// blobs, the note that a restart is refused under --no-persist because there is
// nothing to replay — that is the writing of someone who has hit these cases,
// and none of it is deletable. What was wrong was the order: the two paragraphs
// that disclose what the deck writes and what leaves the machine sat in the two
// highest-value slots on the page — the second paragraph of "Why", and the line
// directly under `npx ccdeck` — where a reader who has not yet decided they want
// the tool met "it rewrites my auth file" and 109 words on 20-byte GETs before
// they had run anything. Both are now under "What it touches", where a reader
// who HAS decided goes looking, and both moved verbatim.
//
// So the regression this file guards is deletion and re-inlining, in both
// directions. A future tidy-up that drops either passage silently removes the
// only place the deck admits what it writes; one that pastes either back into
// "Why" or "Quick start" puts the objection back in front of the desire. The
// passages are therefore asserted word for word AND asserted to appear exactly
// once, since a copy left behind reads as an accident on a page this careful.
//
// The hero is asserted by location only. The shot itself still shows the
// pre-rename wordmark, which no test can see and no edit to this repo can fix —
// it needs re-taking on a current build. What CAN be pinned is that the file
// exists, that it is not embedded from the repo root under a screenshot tool's
// timestamped filename, and that it is reachable at full size, because GitHub
// renders it at roughly half scale. The caption that currently explains the old
// wordmark is deliberately NOT pinned: it has to go the day the shot is
// replaced, and a test holding it in place would be pinning a lie.
//
// PLAIN NODE. The READMEs are read as text; nothing here imports a module that
// touches the filesystem on its own.
