// The finish-sound toggle said "Sound on turn finish" and meant "Claude Code
// turns only" (#394).
//
// The sound is one entry in Claude Code's settings.json — a `Stop` hook whose
// command is notify.mjs, executed by Claude Code itself at the end of a turn.
// Codex never reaches it: the deck installs no Codex hooks (it stopped in the
// commit that introduced Codex support, because they do not fire reliably on
// Windows) and reads the rollout JSONL files after the fact instead. So a Codex
// user turned the switch on and watched turn after turn finish in silence, with
// nothing anywhere to read that silence against — and correct behaviour is
// indistinguishable from a broken toggle when nothing says which it is.
//
// What is asserted here is that the two halves stay together: the mechanism is
// Claude-only, the button is drawn only where Claude Code is, and the sentence
// names the mechanism rather than only the limit. "Claude Code only" is a fact a
// user can act on; "sound" alone is not.
//
// #395 made the deck see the end of a Codex turn — task_complete and
// turn_aborted map to a synthetic `Stop` — so the moment IS known now, and a
// server-side sound became possible where it was not when this issue was filed.
// It is still not this fix, and finishSoundTitle records why: the Claude sound
// is a hook on the machine and fires once with no deck running at all, while a
// server-side one fires once per deck tailing that rollout, only inside that
// deck's workspace, and never with the deck down. The last test below pins the
// premise the whole sentence rests on, so a future provider cannot be added to
// the mechanism while the copy goes on claiming otherwise.
//
// PLAIN NODE. Nothing here renders React — the component source is read as text
// and the pure module is imported. Comments are stripped before every "appears
// nowhere" assertion, because the explanations in this repo quote the strings
// they retire and are supposed to.
