// #442. `sweepStaleSessions` is the stand-in for a `Stop` that never arrived,
// and it used to do only half of what `Stop` does. It settled the root, it
// settled the subagents — and it left the session's `activeSubagentStack`
// exactly as it found it.
//
// A key left on that stack is not inert. `resolveOwner` reads the stack top for
// every event that names no subagent, which is all of the real
// `UserPromptSubmit` and `Pre`/`PostToolUse` traffic, so after a reap the
// human's next prompt and every root-level tool call of the resumed turn were
// drawn on the card of a subagent that had finished two hours earlier. Nothing
// downstream undid it either: `UserPromptSubmit` retires the settled subagent
// and then un-retires it four lines later through `resolveOwner`, both pruners
// decline a node that is `active` again, and `popActive` removes only its own
// key — so the stale one waits UNDERNEATH the next legitimate `SubagentStart`
// and comes back as stack top the moment that one stops.
//
// The premise that makes clearing safe is the sweep's own and is stronger here
// than at `Stop`: a subagent doing long work emits its own Pre/PostToolUse under
// this session id, and each of those stamps the root's `lastEventAt`, so a
// session that reached STALE_SESSION_MS of TOTAL silence has nothing live under
// it whatever the stack still says.
//
// The second half of this file is the interaction #350 left behind. A late event
// un-reaps the ROOT and deliberately does not resurrect the subagents, so the
// stack must stay empty across that recovery: restoring it would hand the
// resumed session's whole turn back to a `done` node, which is the bug above
// re-created by the fix for the session dying. A subagent that really did
// survive re-announces itself, and `pushActive` puts it back the documented way.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the reducer directly.
