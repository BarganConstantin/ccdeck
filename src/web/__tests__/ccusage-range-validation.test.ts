// preflight and no ability to read the answer — so any page the user had open
// could aim `new Image().src = "http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/ccusage?since=…"` at
// the deck. The spawn no longer goes through a shell (ccusage-no-shell.test.ts
// pins that half), which makes this the second lock rather than the only one;
// it is also the one that keeps the pair honest if a shell is ever
// reintroduced downstream.
//

// near a child process.

// The comment this replaces said installs-off was enough — that getRunner

// when #433 gave getRunner its PATH branch, and the branch sits BEFORE the
// installs-off check by design: PATH before installing is what stops the deck
// downloading a second copy of a tool the machine already has. So on any
// machine whose developer has ccusage on PATH — the common case, and this one —
// every accepted request ran that copy instead of refusing. Twice, because
// `--by-agent` fails on a home with no Claude data and runDaily retries the
// flagless form. Measured at 1.2-3.5s a case against vitest's 5000ms default,
// which is #491: not a slow endpoint, an endpoint doing real work nobody
// intended it to do.
//
// An override that does not resolve throws `bad_override` before any process
// starts, and tagged failures are never retried — so this costs one refusal and
// no child at all. It also makes the answer the same everywhere, which the
// PATH-dependent version never was: these cases were fast or slow, and on CI
// will be present or absent, according to whether ccusage happens to be
