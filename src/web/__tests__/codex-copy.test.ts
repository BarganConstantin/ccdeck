// Six strings that told a Codex user something false (#404), and the field that
// would have let them orient themselves.
//
// They were all written when the deck watched one CLI, and none of them was
// revisited when the second one landed. The worst of them was the empty canvas:
// it told a user with nothing on screen to install hooks into
// ~/.codex/hooks.json and to grant them `/hooks` trust on first run. The deck
// stopped installing Codex hooks in the same commit that introduced Codex
// support — installHooks throws on that provider, and the only code that opens
// that file now is the uninstaller — so the one sentence the app offered sent
// that user to hand-write a file the deck never reads and to hunt for a prompt
// that no longer exists, while the three real causes (--no-codex, no rollout
// written yet, CODEX_HOME pointing elsewhere) went unnamed.
//
// The rest were quieter and the same shape: a pulse line asserting every 800ms
// that "hooks cannot find this deck" on a deck whose capture does not use hooks;
// two topbar counters that count both CLIs under tooltips naming one; a README
// tagline promising that Codex forks subagents, which it has never emitted; and
// an empty detail panel waiting for a "first hook" that Codex cannot fire.
//
// The two counters have since been removed from the topbar outright, and
// `sessionsCountTitle` / `eventsCountTitle` with them — a product call about
// which numbers earn a permanent slot, not a retraction of #404. So the block
// below no longer calls those two functions; it holds the rule they were an
// instance of, against the provider-blind numbers the strip still shows.
//
// The fix is gated on `providers` (#402) rather than reworded into vagueness. A
// sentence that is true because it names no path, no flag and no variable is not
// an improvement on a false one — it is the same dead end with better manners —
// so a deck that is not watching a CLI says exactly that.
//
// PLAIN NODE. Nothing here renders React: the component sources are read as
// text and the pure modules are imported. Comments are stripped before any
// "appears nowhere" assertion, because the comments in this repo quote the copy
// they retired and are supposed to.
