// #397: Codex tool outcomes were wrong in BOTH directions.
//
// Direction 1 — a failed Codex tool could never be red. The reducer derives the
// flag from the event NAME (`tc.ok = name === "PostToolUse"`) and the Codex
// mapper hardcoded that name for every output it saw, success or not. `ok` was
// structurally incapable of being false on the Codex path: a command that
// exited non-zero drew green, the detail panel's error count and the session
// summary's "Errors" stat were pinned at 0 for the life of a Codex session, and
// exported session JSON recorded `ok: true` for calls that had failed.
//
// Direction 2 — a call that was merely WAITING was reported as a failure that
// never happened. `sweepStaleTools` reads "no PostToolUse after 90s" as "the
// event was lost", which is true of Claude and false of Codex: Codex appends the
// call line to its rollout at request time, so a call parked on an approval
// prompt is already on the canvas with `endedAt == null`. Ninety seconds later
// the sweep stamped it `ok = false` with `errorPreview = "stale (no PostToolUse
// received)"` — a failure that had not happened, blamed on a mechanism that does
// not exist on this provider.
//
// ── what the rollouts actually say ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every tool result in this machine's CODEX_HOME, 8 files, structural names and
// counts only. Codex prepends its own outcome line to the tool's output; that
// line, not any structured field, is where the verdict lives:
//
//   CLI      tool          first line of output part 0           count
//   0.144.5  exec          "Script completed"                       75
//   0.144.5  exec          "Script failed"                           2
//   0.144.5  apply_patch   "Exit code: 0"                            2
//   0.144.5  exec_command  (bare string, no outcome line at all)    30
//   0.144.5  run           (bare string, no outcome line at all)     2
//   0.147.0  exec          "Script completed"                        6
//
// Two things follow, and both are pinned below. The two CLI versions spell the
// outcome IDENTICALLY — 0.147 renamed the prompt event (#395) but left the exec
// wrapper alone — so one rule covers both with no version sniffing. And the
// outcome line is at part index 0 in 85 of the 85 results that have one, while
// the later parts are the command's own stdout: on this machine two results
// contain a line reading "Script error:" in part 1 under a wrapper that says
// "Script completed", so a rule that scanned every part would paint two
// successful calls red.
//
// The issue's own caveat — "all 8 rollout files contain only successful tool
// calls" — is wrong, and that matters: it was drawn from `patch_apply_end.
// success` (6/6 true), `CommandExecution.exit_code` (2/2 zero) and the call
// lines' `status` (85/85 "completed", including both failed calls, because that
// field is the MODEL's item status and not the execution's). Two exec calls did
// genuinely fail. The evidence was in the output text the issue had set aside.
//

// reducer, with the object shapes copied from real rollout lines.
