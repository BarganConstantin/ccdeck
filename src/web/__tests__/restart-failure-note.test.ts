// A failed `npx -y <spec>@latest` upgrade happens in the SUPERVISOR, after the
// worker that asked for it has already exited. Nothing told the next worker, so
// /api/version kept answering `upgrade: {state:"idle"}` — the banner still
// offered "Update & restart", the tab showed nothing, and the deck came back on
// the old version with no explanation anywhere but the terminal. Reported from
// Windows, where the failure was a broken npx shim and the terminal held a raw
// MODULE_NOT_FOUND stack.
//
// These pin the file the supervisor leaves behind and the rule that decides
// when it still describes this deck.
//
// Naming it after the package alone was not enough, and that is pinned here
// too: two `npx ccdeck` decks share one _npx directory, so they run the same
// package at the same version out of the same home, and the deck that never
// asked for an update read the other one's failure as its own — "update failed"
// in a tab nobody had touched, with its first ever click labelled "Retry
// update". The note is named after the supervisor that wrote it as well.
