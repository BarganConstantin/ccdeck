//   installer.mjs   `"<node>" "<hookPath>" --provider claude` — written into the
//                   user's settings.json as a type:"command" hook, which Claude
//                   Code runs THROUGH A SHELL on every tool call.
//   sound-hook.mjs  `"<node>" "<notifyPath>"` — the same, at the end of a turn.
//   quota.mjs       `"<bin>" --print /usage < /dev/null` — straight into exec().
//
// Every ingredient comes from outside: $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (resolve()d, never
// validated), homedir(), process.execPath, %APPDATA%. A config directory called
// `/tmp/a$(id)b` therefore became shell code — and for the two hook commands,
// shell code PERSISTED into the user's settings file and executed on every hook
// fire. The quieter half cost only the feature: a bare `$` expands to nothing,
// so the hook path silently became wrong and hooks stopped firing with no error.
//
// quota.mjs stopped building a string at all (see quota-source.test.ts —
// quotaClaudeBin answers with the binary and exec.mjs spawns the vector). The
// two hook commands cannot: the settings.json format is a string and has no argv
// form, so they are escaped with a real escaper instead. These pin that escaper
// against a real /bin/sh, which is the only authority worth citing.
