// The detail panel's empty state told everyone the deck "is in `--all` mode and
// listens to every workspace". `--all` is parsed in bin/deck.js and never read
// again — the line that parses it calls it a legacy no-op — so the copy named a
// flag with no behaviour behind it; and for anyone who started the deck with
// `--workspace <path>` or `--scope` it was false, because that really does
// restrict capture. The one sentence a user sees when nothing shows up ruled
// out the actual cause and pointed them at settings.json and their hooks.
//
// It could not have done better: the scope was known to the launcher (printed
// at startup) and to the hook (read from the discovery file), and to no HTTP
// response at all, so the browser had nothing to be right with. Two halves are
// pinned here — that /api/health now reports the workspace it was started with,
// and that each of the three answers it can give produces copy that is true.
