// Reported: persistAuth() staged the refreshed ~/.codex/auth.json in a sibling
// temp file named after the target plus process.pid, and filled it with a plain
// truncating write. A pid names a process, not a write, so that is one file
// shared by every write — the same shape writeFileAtomic had before v1.33.102.
// Two refreshes reaching it together both write their own JSON at offset zero,
// and what gets renamed over auth.json is the shorter payload with the tail of
// the longer one still behind it; the loser then finds its temp file already
// renamed away and throws ENOENT. That is not a retryable failure here: the
// refresh token is single-use and was spent server-side before the write, so a
// lost or spliced one logs the user out of Codex until they run `codex login`.
//
// The second half is the mode. `writeFile`'s `mode` applies only when the call
// creates the file, so a temp left behind by a deck killed between the write and
// the rename — whose pid the OS has since handed back out — was adopted whole,
// keeping its own permissions, and the rotated token sat in it at whatever those
// were until the chmod on the next line. A live refresh token must never be
// readable by another account, not even for that long.
//
// Two instances of the module stand in for two writers at one pid, because the
// module's own refresh queue serializes the writes one layer above the bug —
// what these tests pin is that the temp name survives on its own, which is what
// a second deck on the same home, or one refresh queue away, actually depends on.
