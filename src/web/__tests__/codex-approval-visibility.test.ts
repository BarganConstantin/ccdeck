// #398: a blocked Codex session is invisible on every alarm surface.
//
// The observation is true and this file does not fix it, because it cannot be
// fixed. `root.waiting` has exactly one writer — the reducer's `Notification`
// case — and the Codex path emits no `Notification`, because it is not a hook
// stream at all: it is a reconstruction from the rollout JSONL Codex appends
// under $CODEX_HOME/sessions, and that file carries no approval record.
//
// Sampled every rollout under this machine's CODEX_HOME (structural names and
// keys only, never content): 8 files, ~1,100 records, 20 distinct type names,
// and nothing approval-shaped among them. That absence has a SHAPE, which is
// what makes it evidence rather than a small sample: Codex's persist filter
// keeps outcomes and drops requests, uniformly.
//
//     event_msg/patch_apply_end       6      event_msg/patch_apply_begin     0
//     event_msg/web_search_end        2      event_msg/web_search_begin      0
//     event_msg/item_completed       30      event_msg/item_started          0
//     event_msg/task_complete        57      (no turn_started of any kind)
//
// Every persisted half is the END half, and an approval REQUEST is the other
// half. The CLI binary does carry `exec_approval_request` among its event names,
// so the signal exists in the process and simply never reaches the file;
// `state_5.sqlite`'s `threads` table (37 columns) has `approval_mode` and
// `sandbox_policy` but no status column, so the blocked state is in memory and
// nowhere else on disk.
//
// So the deck cannot know. What it CAN know, and threw away, is
// `turn_context.approval_policy` — the one recorded fact that says whether a
// session is even capable of stopping to ask. The mapper read `model` off that
// record and dropped everything else. 57 of the 58 turn_contexts here are
// "never", where Codex denies an escalation instead of prompting and no block is
// possible at all; 1 is "on-request", where one is.
//
// This file pins both halves: the fact is now carried end to end, and it is
// deliberately NOT turned into an alarm. The last describe is the important one
// — a Codex session with an outstanding tool call under a policy that can ask
// must still count zero blocked, must leave the tab strip untouched, and must
// not disturb a Claude session blocked beside it.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the real translation function,
// the real reducer and the same ambient-counts predicates the app renders from.
