// The invisible per-session drag handle is a React Flow node like any other:
// it is measured, and its size is the whole session box. It never reaches
// autoLayout's `nodes` — App builds the handles from the laid-out cards, after
// the fact — but it does reach `measured`, which is one shared map, and prune
// deliberately keeps its entry alive.
//
// columnGap() used to take the widest value in that map, so the moment one
// session fanned out to subagents its ~1100px handle became the pitch between
// two 240px columns. On a canvas where two columns just fit, the width check
// then failed and every session collapsed into one very tall strip that
// fit-to-view shrank to nothing; on a wider one the columns survived with an
// ~850px band of empty canvas between them.
