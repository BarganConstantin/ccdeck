// Reported: writeFileAtomic built its temp path out of the target plus the pid
// alone, so every write to one file inside one deck shared a single temp file.
// Two clients toggling the sound within the same few milliseconds — two deck
// tabs, or a scripted request — both opened that path with O_TRUNC and both
// wrote their own JSON at offset zero, so what got renamed over settings.json
// was the shorter payload with the tail of the longer one still behind it.
// Unparseable, and readSettingsForWrite turns unparseable into a permanent
// SETTINGS_UNREADABLE refusal: every later toggle and every hook install
// declines until the user repairs the file by hand. The writer that lost the
// race found its temp file already renamed away and threw ENOENT on top of it.
// These tests run the writes genuinely at once and pin both halves — every
// writer gets a temp file of its own, and the target is left as one whole
// payload rather than a splice of two.
