// the set handed to dagre the instant it was rescued, and the "fresh layout
// pass" the invalidation below it promised never reconsidered it: the only pass
// that still touched it was separateOverlaps, which resolves on Y alone, so the
// node lived out the tab in the x=0 column at whatever height stopped it
// colliding — no relation to its parent, its rank or its session.
//
// These drive the real passes in the order App.tsx runs them, because the bug
// is not in any one of them: it is in what `positions` was asked to mean.
