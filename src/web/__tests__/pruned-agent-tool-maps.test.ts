// #443. `toolIndex` and `toolOwner` are keyed by tool_use_id and live for the
// whole board, not per agent. Four sites used to write or clear them —
// `PreToolUse` sets both, `PostToolUse` clears both when the call settles,
// `trimTools` clears both when a call falls out of the 200-per-agent window, and
// `sweepStaleTools` clears both when it settles a lost call — and every one of
// them reaches an entry only THROUGH the owning agent. So when `pruneOldAgents`
// or `pruneDoneSessions` deleted an agent that still had a call in flight, the
// entry it left behind was reachable by nothing at all: not `PostToolUse`, whose
// resurrection scan walks `state.agents`; not either sweep, which iterate the
// same map; not `trimTools`, which runs only from its own agent's `PreToolUse`;
// and not the collector, since the map held the last strong reference to a
// `ToolCall` that still carried its whole `tool_input`.
//
// The size of it, measured rather than assumed: replaying this machine's entire
// 21-hour events.jsonl with both pruners live evicted 16 agents and orphaned
// zero ids, because on Claude a session killed mid-call never reaches `done` in
// the first place — no `Stop` arrives — and `sweepStaleTools` releases its calls
// on the same tick and the same window that `sweepStaleSessions` uses to reap it
// (#436). What is left is the pair of cases below: Codex, where the sweep
// deliberately abstains (#397) so pruning is the only bound on an approval
// prompt nobody answered, and Claude where a `PostToolUse` went missing but the
// `Stop` that ends the agent still landed. This is a tidiness fix at the scale
// this machine runs at, and the tests are about the contract, not the bytes.
//
// The half worth guarding is the other direction. A tool id does not belong to
// one `ToolCall` forever: a re-delivered `PreToolUse` for an id that already
// settled finds nothing in `toolIndex`, and `resolveOwner` hands it to whoever
// the attribution stack names at that moment, which is a different agent once a
// subagent has started in between — so both maps end up pointing at a NEW call
// on a LIVE agent while the old object stays in the finished agent's list.
// Releasing by id alone would let pruning the finished one evict the live one,
// and the last block here pins that it does not.
//
// No DOM — plain node, vitest — so this drives the reducer directly.
