// #316: the search dimmed nothing, because an entrance animation was still
// filling over it.
//
// #266 was one bubble's hover lift losing to `bubble-spawn`'s filled transform.
// The mechanism is general and it reached much further than a hover: both spawn
// animations are declared on a base class — `.tool-burst` and
// `.react-flow__node` — so they are attached for the element's whole life, and
// `both` keeps them applying their last keyframe long after they have finished.
// A filling animation outranks every author declaration under it. Both terminal
// keyframes restated `opacity` and `filter`, and `opacity` and `filter` are the
// only two properties `.tool-burst.dim` and `.react-flow__node.rf-spotlit-out`
// have. Both were dead: the class went on, and the board did not change. (A
// third, `.rf-dim`, was the /-search's own and went with the field.) Reduced
// motion swapped the entrance for `fadeIn`, also with `both`, also ending on
// `opacity: 1`, so it was dead there too.
//
// The fix is not a higher-priority declaration — `!important` would beat the
// animation and lose the ability to layer the dim with anything else. It is to
// leave the property out of the last keyframe, which hands it back to the
// cascade: the animation interpolates towards the element's own value and, once
// filling, simply is it, so a class added a second or an hour later lands.
//
// Hence the invariant swept below, which is wider than the two selectors: no
// animation an element can still be running may name a property that a rule on
// that same element needs to win. "Can still be running" is a fill mode that
// includes forwards, or an infinite duration — an infinite animation never
// stops, so for those every keyframe counts, not just the last.
//
// Exempt: `.fading` and `.rf-exiting`. Those animations are the state, not a
// competitor to it — the element is being removed on a wall-clock timer and has
// nothing left to say about the selection.
