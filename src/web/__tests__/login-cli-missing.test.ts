// A `claude` that cannot be run at all is the one sign-in failure the deck
// diagnoses perfectly — and then threw away twice over.
//
// With AGENTS_DECK_CLAUDE pointing at nothing, or with no claude on PATH, the
// child is gone in milliseconds and exec.mjs reports it the same way on every
// platform: `{code:"ENOENT"}`, whether from a POSIX spawn error or from the last
// Windows candidate spelling after cmd.exe answered "is not recognized" for the
// .cmd shim. The flow's own done handler turns that into "the claude CLI could
// not be run: not on PATH. Set AGENTS_DECK_CLAUDE to its full path." — the only
// sentence in the whole sign-in that names a fix — within a beat of the start.
//
// startLogin never looked. It polled for a url that could not arrive, held the
// POST open for the full fifteen seconds, and then published "the claude CLI did
// not print a sign-in link" over the flow, destroying the diagnosis on the
// server. What reached the person watching the dialog was a fifteen-second
// spinner followed by a guess.
