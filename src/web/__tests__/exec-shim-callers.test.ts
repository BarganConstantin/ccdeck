// #457. #450/#456 fixed the `%~dp0` shim bug for ccusage's `npm.cmd` and
// `npx.cmd` and stopped there. The same shape was still live in the three
// general spawn helpers — `run`, `runInteractive`, `runDetached` — which is
// where `claude.cmd` (the quota poll, and the whole sign-in flow) and cswap's
// shim are launched from.
//
// The defect, restated once: a `.cmd` shim locates its own payload as
// `%~dp0\node_modules\…`, and `%~dp0` is the drive-and-path of the command token
// cmd.exe was handed. A BARE name carries no directory, so `%~dp0` came out as
// the deck's WORKING DIRECTORY. From the reporting machine, deck started in
// `C:\Users\vceban`:
//
//     Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\vceban\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-prefix.js'
//
// Two things are pinned here, and the second is the one #456 called the reason
// it stopped short:
//
//   1. The command line every affected caller produces on Windows names an
//      ABSOLUTE `.cmd`, never a bare one — and falls back to exactly today's
//      bare name when no layout can be seen, so nothing that works can break.
//   2. `looksMissing` is told the spelling cmd.exe was ACTUALLY GIVEN. It
//      compares that against the name cmd.exe echoes back, so once the token
//      became a path a check against the bare candidate stops matching and a
//      genuinely absent CLI stops reporting as absent.
//
// Plain node, no jsdom, nothing rendered. The platform is a parameter
// throughout, so the Windows answers are checked from macOS; the two end-to-end
// runs stand cmd.exe up as a shell script, the way exec-windows.test.ts does.
