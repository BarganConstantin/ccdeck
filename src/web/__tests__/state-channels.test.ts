// #373: the state of a session and the outcome of a tool call were each drawn
// as one dot in one of three hues, and the dot was hidden from assistive tech.
//
// The visual half. Every hue clears 1.4.11 against the panel it is drawn on —
//
//   state          dark, on --panel / --bg-soft      light, on --panel / --bg-soft
//   active         10.29 / 10.73                     6.98 / 6.98
//   done           12.89 / 13.45                     5.42 / 5.42
//   err             9.54 /  9.95                     6.47 / 6.47
//
// — so nothing here was ever a boundary failure, exactly as in #370. What none
// of it does is separate the three states from EACH OTHER:
//
//   pair                    dark      light
//   active vs done          1.25:1    1.29:1
//   active vs err           1.08:1    1.08:1
//   done vs err             1.35:1    1.19:1
//
// A WCAG ratio is computed from relative luminance and nothing else, so those
// six numbers ARE the greyscale test: at 1.08:1 a running session and a failed
// one are the same grey, and done against err — the red/green pair, the worst
// one to lean on — is 1.35:1 dark and 1.19:1 light. Well under the 3:1 a
// non-text difference needs, in both themes, on every bed.
//
// The semantic half. `SessionList` and `UsagePanel` marked the dot aria-hidden
// and put the state nowhere else, so the row announced "vcrm-core Opus 5 9
// tools $3.66 waiting 19s" and a reader was told everything about the session
// except whether it was alive. `ToolRow`'s dot was not even aria-hidden, but an
// empty <span> has nothing to contribute to a name either: a failed call and a
// finished one both said "Bash 1.2s".
//
// And a third defect the report did not have: every `.sl-dot` rule was scoped
// to `.session-list`, while `UsagePanel` renders that class in a panel that is
// the sidebar's SIBLING. Those dots matched no rule at all and were drawn as
// zero-sized empty spans — not hue-only, nothing at all.
//
// The fix is the deck's own two answers, not new ones. The second channel is
// the mark: ✓ and × are what a tool bubble on the canvas has drawn for done and
// err since ToolBursts existed, and they read the same in greyscale, under
// every colour vision deficiency and with motion turned off — the shape channel
// #370 reached for when it flipped a toggle's polarity rather than tinting it
// harder. The spoken channel is a visually-hidden word in the same utility
// AccountsPanel already uses, sharing one vocabulary with the card's StatePill.
//
// Plain node, no DOM — React cannot be rendered in this suite — so this reads
// styles.css and the markup the way manage-block.test.ts, control-edges.test.ts
// and toggle-state.test.ts do, and computes every ratio from the sheet's own
// token values. The helpers are re-declared rather than imported from another
// *.test.ts: importing one registers its suites into this file as well.
