// `node src/server/index.mjs` — the dev entry point behind `npm run dev:server`
// — took its port from CCGRAPH_PORT, a name left over from the project's first
// identity two renames ago (ccgraph → agent-dag → agents-deck). It is written
// down nowhere, so the one port variable that is documented, AGENT_DAG_PORT,
// was silently ignored on exactly the path a contributor reaches for first
// (#256). Nothing shipped is affected: the binaries go through bin/deck.js.
//
// The check has to be a real launch. The port is read inside the
// `import.meta.url === argv[1]` guard, which by construction never runs when
// the module is imported, so importing it would test nothing at all.
