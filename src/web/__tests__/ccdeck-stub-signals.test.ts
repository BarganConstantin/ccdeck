// What a signal aimed at `npx ccdeck` does to the deck underneath it.
//
// The stub trapped nothing, so the tree it starts — ccdeck.js → agent-dag.js →
// deck.js — came apart at the top the moment anything signalled the launcher by
// pid: a systemd unit without KillMode=control-group, a supervisor that signals
// only the main pid, a hand-typed `kill`. Measured before the fix, the stub was
// gone in six milliseconds and the deck was still running seconds later, still
// serving on 4317 and still advertising a live pid in its discovery file. Hooks
// keep posting to a deck the user believes is stopped, and the next `npx ccdeck`
// finds the port taken.
//
// Ctrl+C is why it survived: that signals the whole foreground process group and
// the deck gets its own copy without the stub's help. Which is also why the
// obvious fix — forward every signal, always — is not one. Under Ctrl+C the
// forwarded copy lands about a millisecond behind the terminal's as a SECOND
// signal, and agent-dag.js reads a second signal as an impatient user and
// answers it by SIGKILLing deck.js: the discovery file it was partway through
// removing stays behind. So both directions are pinned here, and the group case
// is the one that fails against the naive patch.
//
// The stub is only itself inside a real install layout, so each test builds one
// in a temp directory and runs the shipped file unmodified. The fake deck
// re-exports the repo's real supervisor.mjs rather than copying it; the fake
// agent-dag.js is a few lines that log every signal they receive and then shut
// down a beat later on their own terms, the way deck.js does. Nothing is
// installed and no npx runs.
//
// Everything here waits on an event — the fake deck announcing itself, the stub
// handling a signal, the stub exiting — and never on a sleep, because #343 is
// what a fixed sleep costs on a box running twenty other things. The one
// deadline that cannot be an event is the Windows case, which is an assertion
// that nothing happens; see it there.
