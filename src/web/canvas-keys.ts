// What the keyboard means on the canvas.
//
// Three separate holes made the deck unusable without a mouse, and all three
// were decisions about focus rather than about rendering, so they live here
// where a plain-node test can read them (the same reason shortcuts.ts and
// modal-dismiss.ts exist).
//
// 1. Escape was the only way back to <body> and it did not take it. The
//    window handler in App.tsx refuses to claim a keystroke aimed at a focused
//    control — correctly, or a bare "c" from a <select> would truncate the
//    event log — but every control on this deck is a <button>, so the first
//    Tab killed all thirteen single-key shortcuts for the rest of the session.
//    Escape released focus only when the user was TYPING, which a button never
//    is, and tabbing off the end of the document wraps to the first control
//    rather than to the body. There was no keyboard route back at all; the
//    only fix on offer was a mouse click on empty canvas.
//
// 2. Enter on a focused agent card did nothing whatsoever. React Flow makes
//    every node a tabbable role="button" and answers Enter/Space itself, but
//    its handler routes through the store's updateNodesAndEdgesSelections,
//    which only writes when `hasDefaultNodes` is set — i.e. when React Flow
//    owns the node array. This deck passes `nodes` as a controlled prop with
//    no onNodesChange, so that write is skipped and the app's own
//    onNodeClick — the single door to selectAgent — is never called from the
//    keyboard. The card was announced as a button and was not one.
//
// 3. And while a card held focus the deck's shortcuts were dead for the same
//    reason a button kills them: role="button" is role="button". But a card is
//    not a control the user typed into, it is the canvas itself wearing a role
//    React Flow chose. It owns its activation keys and its arrows; every other
//    key is still the deck's.
//
// Kept as data-in / decision-out functions with no DOM: App.tsx reads the id
// off the focused element and hands it here.
