                without a second chart — the panel is already dense, and the
                issue rules both of those out for that reason.

                Drawn ONLY for two or more CLIs. A machine that has only ever
                run Claude Code gets no bar and no key, which is the same panel
                it has today; so does a range answered by a ccusage too old to
                know `--by-agent`, because agentTotals comes back empty for it.

                WIDTH, since #369 pinned this modal's geometry and #462 had to
                retrofit an ellipsis onto the one column here that had no
                overflow protection. Neither shape below has a column to
                overflow: the bar is `width: 100%` of the content box and its
                segments are percentages of that, and the key is a wrapping flex
                row modelled on `.uh-legend`. The content box is 724px — the
                modal is `min(760px, 100%)` less 18px of padding a side — and a
                key entry is about 165px (an 8px dot, a name, a cost and a
                share, at 11px), so the two entries this normally has occupy
                under half a line and even six CLIs simply wrap. That matters
                more than it looks: ccusage reads sixteen sources, so the count
                here is not bounded at two by anything, and a fixed grid would
