 * 31.7 columns of a 6.62px advance before the ellipsis on `.session-name`
 * fires.
 * A header showing MORE than the card would put the only copy of a tail in a
 * tooltip; at 32 it never does, and both surfaces cut at the same word.
 *
 * What it is worth, measured in a browser against this sheet rather than
 * estimated: the longest agentName in the transcripts on this machine is 53
 * characters, "Refactor mailbox controller request response handling", and it
 * draws a 481.3px header. Capped, the same header is 350.7px. The narrowest
 * cluster there is — one 240px card plus PAD on both sides — is 276px wide and
 * the pill starts 16px inside it, so the overhang goes from 221.3px to 90.7px.
 * layout.ts leaves a full card width, 240px, of clear canvas between two
 * session columns, so a capped header stays inside that gutter and cannot
 * reach the box next door. An uncapped one could.
 *
 * The overhang itself is not new and is not the name: the pill is
 * `white-space: nowrap` in a layer that clips nothing, so it has always run
 * past the box it labels rather than wrapping, clipping or widening it — a
 * long workspace basename alone overhangs a one-card cluster by 21.2px today.
 * What the name changes is the magnitude, and the cap is the whole answer to
 * that. It is also why the cap is not tied to the cluster width: at 276px the
 * budget would be 17 columns, shorter than every name measured here, and a cap
 * that fires every time is not a cap.
 *
 * The field carries `ai-title` sentences now as well as `agent-name` slugs, and
 * the number survives that unchanged — checked rather than assumed. It is
 * derived from where the CARD ellipsises, which is a fact about a 240px node
 * and says nothing about which record filled it, and the bound it buys is a
 * bound on the OUTPUT: 32 columns draw the same 350.7px header whatever went in,
 * so the longest title measured here (64 code points, "Explore hotkey and global
 * search features in VCRM Angular portal") lands on the same overhang as the
 * 53-character name above. What did change is how often it fires — 4 of the 10
 * distinct names here exceed 32 columns, against 198 of the 299 distinct titles,
 * so the cap went from a guard to the ordinary path.
