// The one way a modal in this app answers Escape, holds Tab, and gives focus
// back.
//
// Every modal used to spell its own dismissal, which is how two of the five
// ended up with no Escape handler at all and how the three that had one fought
// the window-level handler in App.tsx. The rules live in modal-dismiss.ts; this
// is the React that attaches them, so the sixth modal cannot forget them and
// there is no fourth spelling to keep in step.
//
// Focus is the same story one layer down. Three of the six never took focus at
// all when they opened, and none of the six kept it: a dialog claiming
// `aria-modal="true"` sat over a document whose every control was still a Tab
// away, behind a scrim that paints over all of it. So the same hook now owns
// where focus starts, where Tab may go while the dialog is up, and where focus
// lands when it closes — one place, six overlays.
