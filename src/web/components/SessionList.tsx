/** Where a row sorts, before activity is looked at. A blocked session is the

 *  one — and a permission prompt outranks an idle one, because the first is a
 *  decision a session is stalled on and the second is a turn that simply ended.
 *  Waiting is not the row's `state`: an idle_prompt sits on a session that is
 *  legitimately done and still reads `done` two columns to the left.
 *
 *  Exported for the suite, along with buildRows below (#378). Both were
 *  module-private, which meant a bare-node suite could not call either and the
 *  only thing standing over this ordering was a regex matching the literal text
 *  `isAlarming(r.waiting) ? 0 : 1` somewhere in this file. Measured: reversing
 *  the two tiers here AND reversing the longest-blocked-first comparator below
 *  left all 1849 tests green, because the reversed expressions still contain
 *  the text the regex looked for. Neither function renders anything — they are
 *  a rule about what the sidebar puts at the top, and a rule that cannot be
 *  called is a rule nothing can check. */

                  "vcrm-core Opus 5 9 tools $3.66 waiting 19s" and the state was

                  already has one, and for an element with contents `title` is
