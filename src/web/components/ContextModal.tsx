// Read-only modal showing the breakdown of a session's context window — message
// counts, tool calls, the memory files in scope, and the token totals split by
// billing bucket.
//
// HOW MUCH OF IT IS KNOWN DEPENDS ON THE PROVIDER, and every section below says
// which it is rather than rendering the same layout over two different degrees
// of certainty. For Claude Code this is an approximation: the real `/context`
// view is not exposed to a hook, so the counts come from a regex scan of the
// transcript JSONL on the server. For Codex the occupancy and the window are the
// CLI's own numbers, stated on every `token_count` record and exact — while the
// composition counts are not available at all, because there is no transcript to
// scan and the rollout watcher skips a session's history when it attaches. That
// section says so instead of printing five zeroes (#399).

            regex scan of a transcript the server has read from byte zero. Codex
            has no transcript to scan — the deck reconstructs the session by
            tailing the rollout JSONL, and at startup it deliberately skips
            whatever was already in the file, so a count kept from the moment the
            deck attached would be short by however much of the session happened
            first and would carry no sign of it.

            Printing five zeroes there was the option this rejected. The card
            beside this modal already shows a real tool count, so zeroes would
            not even read as "nothing happened" — they would read as a broken
            panel, and the one thing a context breakdown cannot afford is being
            confidently wrong about what is in the window. This is the shape #398
            gave a Codex session's approval state and #416 gave an unpriced
            model: say what cannot be known, in the slot the answer would have
