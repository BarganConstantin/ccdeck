// A one-off burst, for the one moment in this app that deserves one.
//
// Adding an account is rare — a handful of times in a deck's life — which is
// the only reason a celebration is defensible here at all. Anything a user sees
// dozens of times a day gets no animation; this they see almost never, and it
// is the moment a live credential finished moving between two machines, where
// "did that work?" is a real question.
//
// Rendered through a portal at fixed coordinates rather than inside the dialog.
// The first version lived in the dialog body and was invisible: .modal has
// overflow: hidden and .modal-body has overflow: auto, so every particle that
// left the text column was clipped — and the ones that did not were about to
// give the body a scrollbar. Escaping the stacking context is not a flourish
// here, it is the only way the effect exists at all.
//
// Deliberately small: no canvas, no library, no dependency. Particles are spans
// carrying their own vector in CSS custom properties, animated with transform
// and opacity only — both GPU properties — then unmounted when the burst ends
// so nothing is left running behind a dialog.
