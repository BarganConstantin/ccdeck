// Without a modifier check the deck answers the browser's own chords: copying a
// line of tool output ran Clear, which empties the server's ring buffer and
// truncates the events file it replays from, and every Ctrl+R refresh threw
// away the layout the persistence feature exists to keep.
//
// Ctrl and Cmd both count, because the copy/refresh chord is Ctrl on Linux and
// Windows and Cmd on macOS, and a build has no way to know which one is in
// front of it. Alt joins them for the menu chords (Alt+F opens the browser's
// File menu). Shift deliberately does not: the handler already treats "C" and
// "c" alike, so Shift+letter is ours to keep.
//
// Kept out of App.tsx so the rule can be tested without a DOM.

// the app defenceless: with a toolbar button focused, Space ran preventDefault
// and toggled pause, and a canceled Space keydown also suppresses the button's
// own activation, so a keyboard user pressing the button they had just tabbed
// to paused the stream instead. The version banner's dismiss control was a
// role="button" span with its own Space handler before it became a real
// <button>, and the clickable tool bursts were another until they went back to
// being the decoration they are drawn as, so one keypress did two unrelated
// things. Worst of all, with one of the accounts panel's <select>s focused — a
// panel that opens by default — a bare "c" reached Clear, which empties the
// server's ring buffer and truncates events.jsonl with no confirmation and no
// undo.
//
// A focused control owns its own keys and the deck only gets what is left:
// <select> matches bare letters as type-ahead, a checkbox and a <button> and
// any role="button" answer Space, a contenteditable answers everything.
//
// The one exception is the canvas itself. React Flow dresses every agent card
// as a tabbable role="button", which made this rule kill all thirteen
// shortcuts for as long as a card held focus — see canvas-keys.ts, which
// settles what a card owns before App.tsx reaches this gate.

 * Whether a canvas-level shortcut must stay out of the way because a modal is

 *
 * `ownsKeystroke` above asks the FOCUSED ELEMENT whether it owns the key, which
 * is the right question for a text field and the wrong one for a dialog.
 * use-modal-dismiss.ts states it outright: "clicking a paragraph of modal text
 * drops focus on `<body>`" — and BODY is in neither KEY_OWNING_TAGS nor
 * KEY_OWNING_ROLES. So reading a tool call's JSON payload and then pressing a
 * letter ran that letter against the canvas behind the scrim.
 *
 * R was the one that hurt. It clears every pin, every stored position and both
 * localStorage keys, so an arrangement built by hand was gone with no undo — and
 * the user did not see it happen until they closed the modal. H stacked a second
 * modal over the first; Space paused the stream; A, U and L opened panels
 * underneath.
 *
 * The rule is not new: it is the one `c` already had. What was missing is that
 * it had exactly one caller.
 *
 * `?` is the single exception and only for the sheet itself, because it is
 * advertised as a toggle and has to be able to close what it opened. Over any
 * other modal it would stack a second one, which is the thing being prevented.
 * Escape is not on this path at all — it is answered through modalStack.
