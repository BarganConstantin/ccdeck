// What the accounts panel says when a reload does not land, and which of two
// messages is still on screen once one does.
//
// The panel's ↻ and its 15-second poll shared one load() whose catch was empty
// and whose two `if (res.ok)` guards dropped a refusal on the floor. A thrown
// fetch and a 500 both left every piece of state exactly as it stood, so a
// reload that failed was indistinguishable from one that came back with the
// same numbers — and the very first load failing left "Checking…" on screen
// with no branch behind it, because the panel's only failure box lives inside
// the branch that needs data to render.
//
// The ranking is not a new one. These two routes refuse in the same shape the
// switch and auto-switch POSTs already do, so explainCommandFailure picks the
// words and the subprocess's own output stays in the title, where a traceback
// cannot fill a 288px box.
//
// Out here rather than in the component because the suite has no DOM: React
// cannot be rendered in it, so the rules live where they can be called
// directly — the same reason admin-failure.ts and login-flow.ts do.

 * enough to copy into an issue and far enough not to be the message.
 *
 * `reload` marks the messages this module produced. They are the only ones that
 * clear themselves, because the next reload is the thing that disproves them; a
