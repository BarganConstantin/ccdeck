// Rolling ccusage's per-day `agents` arrays up into one figure per CLI.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. #431's complaint is that the usage-history modal
// named two CLIs in its subtitle and then showed one merged number, so "how
// much of this is Codex?" had no answer anywhere on the panel. The fix has two
// halves — ask ccusage for the split (`--by-agent`, in ccusage.mjs) and draw it
// — and the drawing half is arithmetic plus a colour, neither of which needs a
// DOM. Kept out of UsageHistoryModal.tsx for the same reason usage-view.ts,
// usage-range.ts, providers.ts and provider-copy.ts are: the branches that
// matter are the ones nobody exercises by hand — a Codex-only machine, a
// ccusage too old to report agents at all, a range where one CLI's share
// rounds to nothing — and they can be read and tested here without rendering
// React. The test environment is plain Node, so a rule that lives in a .tsx is
// a rule the suite cannot reach.

 * matching those hues makes the split strip read as a summary of the chart
 * above it rather than as a second, unrelated key.
 *
 * Everything unrecognised is one zinc, and that is a real limit rather than an
 * oversight: ccusage reads sixteen CLIs and three of them at once would draw
 * three identical segments. It is left alone because the name and the figure
 * sit next to each colour in the key, so the colour is a shortcut and never the
 * only way to tell two rows apart — and inventing a hue by hashing an id would
 * put unreadable-against-the-panel colours on screen to solve a case nobody has
 * yet reported.
 *
 * The palette is five `var(--usage-…)` names rather than five hexes as of #583,
 * for the reason `modelColor` spells out: the literals here were the dark
 * canvas's pastels, an inline `style` is unreachable from the sheet, and on
 * white they were 1.40:1 to 2.56:1 against the panel they were drawn on. The
 * mapping is still this function's; only the values moved to :root, where each
