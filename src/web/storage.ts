// Throwing away saved state that a new version can no longer read.
//
// The deck upgrades itself now, so a tab can go from one version to the next
// without anyone clearing anything. Most of what it stores is preferences —
// theme, which panels are open, whether auto-restart is on — and those survive
// any release. Two keys do not: the saved layout and the viewport hold the
// SHAPE the canvas code expected at the time, so a release that changes that
// shape leaves the next boot reading positions keyed to node ids that no longer
// exist. That is a broken canvas with no visible cause and no obvious fix
// besides "clear site data", which nobody thinks to do.
//
// The version number is deliberately NOT the package version. Clearing the
// layout on every patch release would throw away hand-arranged canvases for no
// reason; this is bumped by hand, in the same commit that changes the shape.
