   *  `tabIndex={-1}` is on <main> so the skip link has somewhere to land, and
   *  it buys a second thing nobody asked for: an element a MOUSE can focus. A
   *  click on empty canvas parked focus on the canvas with nothing on screen to
   *  say so, and the next keystroke — any keystroke, including the ones the
   *  deck has no shortcut for — made the browser change its mind about
   *  `:focus-visible` for the element that was already focused. Selectors 4
   *  allows exactly that, and Chrome does it: the ring the skip link needs lit
   *  up around the whole window on a press the user reads as re-layout or a
   *  theme swap, and stayed until focus moved.
   *
   *  So the fix is here and not in the stylesheet, which cannot reach this.
   *  `:focus-visible` is the browser's own judgement, re-made AFTER focus has
   *  landed, so no selector can tell the two arrivals apart — CSS could only
   *  overrule the ring with `outline: none`, and the sheet is allowed exactly
   *  one of those (#368 pins the count, because a rule that quietly removes a
   *  focus ring is how the search field lost its own). Dropping the ring
   *  altogether is not on offer either: #381 put it there because landing
   *  somewhere with no sign you landed is the failure the skip link exists to
   *  fix. What is left is to take away the arrival that was never wanted. The
   *  ring is untouched, and the one path that can still reach it is the
   *  programmatic focus it was written for.
   *
   *  Capture phase, which is a measurement and not a preference: React Flow's
   *  pan handler calls stopImmediatePropagation() on the pane's mousedown, so a
   *  bubbling handler on <main> never sees the click that causes this at all.
   *  Cancelling the default costs the canvas nothing — panning, node drags,
   *  onPaneClick and the context menu all run off events of their own, and none

   * it would make and expects them to be applied. Nothing applied them, so the
   * only thing that has ever moved a node here is this array being rebuilt —

   *
   * Hence the shape of the bug: a slow drag looked fine because four updates a
   * second is enough to look continuous, and a fast one visibly stepped and
   * trailed, because the gap between updates is however far the cursor got in
   * 250ms.
   *
   * So the drag is applied here instead, on every pointer move: the base array
   * is left to rebuild at its own pace, and the positions of the nodes being
   * dragged are patched over it. A patch is one shallow copy per node, which
   * is nothing next to rebuilding the graph from the event log — and it is the
   * whole reason the previous two attempts failed. Both tried to make the

          Before this the whole page was <div>s apart from the topbar, so a
          screen reader's landmark rotor listed one entry — Banner — for an
          application with five regions, and there was no way to move between
          them except Tab.
          Four landmarks, each of which is a region a reader would actually
          jump to: the topbar is the banner it already was, the canvas is
          <main> because it is this page's subject and everything else on
          screen is beside it, and the three panels are <aside>s because each
          one is commentary on the canvas that comes and goes without changing
          what the canvas shows. None of them is invented for the rotor's sake:
          the two that were already <aside> — the session list and the detail
          panel — are unchanged in shape here and only gained the name one of
          them was missing.
          Deliberately NOT added: a <nav>, because this deck has no navigation
          — the session list moves the camera, it does not move the user
          between documents — and a role="search" around the filter box, which
          would be a landmark wrapped around a single input that the rotor
          already lists under Form Controls by its own aria-label. A landmark
          list padded with regions nobody would navigate to is the same defect
          as no landmarks at all, one direction over.
          The panels are conditional (#402 made the accounts one conditional on
          Claude Code being installed at all), so the rotor's contents change
          with what is open. That is correct: an <aside> that is not rendered
          is not a region that is empty, and the toggles that mount them
          already carry aria-expanded. */}

          It exists because there are ~166 focusable controls between the top
          of the document and the canvas once the panels are open, and until
          now a keyboard user had to walk every one of them to reach the thing
          the deck is for. WCAG 2.4.1. The target is <main> rather than the

            The bar used to be a brand and one flat run of eight controls with
            the readout strip wedged in front of them, and the only thing
            marking the seam between "what is happening" and "what I can do to
            it" was `.status { margin-right: 6px }` — 14px against the 8px
            between two buttons. A 1.75x step under 16px does not read as a
            group boundary, while `.stat + .stat::before` draws a real 1px rule
            between tokens and cost. So the bar said the break between two
            numbers was larger than the break between the last number and the
            first control, which is exactly backwards. The dividers were never
            the defect; the large boundary having no mark at all was.

            light that has to be noticed cannot be a moving target. Everything
            ahead of it here (the logo, the wordmark, the version chip) has

              whenever they want one, and every number in it still moves on its
              own — tokens climbs on every event carrying usage, and the cost

              the topbar (#372).
              MOUNTED UNCONDITIONALLY, which is the half that looks redundant and
              is not. A screen reader registers a live region when the region
              enters the accessibility tree, and text that arrives in the same
              tick as the region itself is routinely never announced at all. The
              chip below is mounted only while something is blocked, so wrapping
              THAT in a role="status" would have put the region and its first
              words on screen together — the one announcement that matters, on
              the one delivery screen readers are least reliable about. It would
              also have taken the region away again with the chip, leaving
              nowhere to say the block had cleared. So the region is always here
              and only its text moves.
              POLITE, not assertive, and that was a decision rather than a
              default. `role="alert"` interrupts whatever is being spoken, which
              buys at most the length of one utterance — and a blocked session
              waits indefinitely, so nothing is lost by arriving a sentence
              later. What assertive would cost is concrete: a deck reloaded while
              a session is already blocked replays that block during mount, and
              an assertive region firing there talks over the screen reader's own
              announcement of the page the user just opened. The connection
              banner keeps role="alert" because its failure is the other kind —
              once the stream is dead every number on this page is stale and the
              deck is quietly lying, so a deferred announcement is a user acting
              on dead data.
              role="status" carries an implicit aria-atomic="true"; it is written
              out because this sentence only means anything whole, and because a
              partial reading of it is exactly the failure the strip above was
              guilty of. */}

              was given.
              The half that expired: "a control has no business inside a live
              region". .status was one when this was written and #372 took the
              role off it, so that argument has had nothing to point at for a
              while. The half that still does the work is the one about the
              strip itself — .status is a run of readouts whose boundaries are
              drawn by `.stat + .stat::before`, and a button dropped into that
              run would either take one of those 1px rules or break the run in
              two. Its group is the readout, because what it reports is
              observation; its element is a button, because the number is the
              only one in the bar the user is meant to act on. Click goes to the
              session that has been stuck longest, which is both the one the
              deck was left open for and the one the region above names.
              It says nothing when nothing is blocked, and it never speaks for
              Codex: those sessions emit no notification, so counting them would
              turn "we have no signal" into "they are fine". It carries no live
              region of its own; the div above is where the speaking happens,

              in the sheet.
              The runs are Pause; the three disclosures ($ , accounts, history);

                the eight buttons after it that move — .actions is flex: none
                against a space-between bar, so the icon runs stay pinned to the
                right edge — it is the button itself and the selected-agent
                ribbon, which slides by half the delta because the free space is
                shared between the two gaps. Measured at 1470: pressing Space
                walks the button 45px left and the ribbon 28px, and every digit
                the held count gains walks both again.
                The ghost below is what pins it. The alternative was a min-width
                in pixels, which is the usual idiom in this sheet and is the
                wrong tool for a string: the number would be measured in the font
                this machine renders and shipped to Segoe UI and fontconfig,
                where a wider face overruns it and the reflow is back. A hidden
                copy of the widest label in the same grid cell measures itself,
                in whatever font arrives, on every platform this deck runs on.
                No apostrophe anywhere in this comment, deliberately, and the
                sound button at the end of the bar spells out why: the tag
                scanner in control-edges.test.ts tracks quotes, and a lone
                apostrophe inside a JSX brace opens a string nothing closes.

          the one.

          returns false and the deck's single-key shortcuts keep working from
          it, and Escape releases it back to the document like any other
          non-typing target.

          focuses, which it also is by default and which lit the skip link's

          releasePointerFocus is where that half is taken back, and it has to be

            decoration now, because the stylesheet draws its ✓ and × with

            aria-hidden the row would say the mark and then the word.
            The word leads, where the dot is, for the reason the session list
            gives — the accessible name is the contents in DOM order, so
            "error Bash 1.24s" is read in the order it is seen. */}
