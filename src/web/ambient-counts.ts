// The two numbers the alarm surfaces are driven from, and the one predicate
// that decides what an alarm is.
//
// #377: the alarm rule used to be written out by hand in four places — App.tsx's
// blocked memo, SessionList.tsx's header count, SessionList.tsx's row sort, and
// a copy inside ambient-signal.test.ts that carried the comment "exactly what
// App.tsx's two memos compute". #348 narrowed the rule to permission-only and
// reached the three in the app; the one in the test was never touched, so for
// thirty-odd releases the suite asserted the superseded counting as correct
// behaviour and would have gone green on the day the regression came back. The
// only thing standing between the codebase and that was two `toMatch` regexes
// over App.tsx's source text, which any rephrasing of the expression breaks and
// any comment containing the same words satisfies.
//
// A rule that has to be mirrored by hand is a rule that drifts, and prose in a
// test cannot stop it. So the rule lives here exactly once, the call sites call
// it, and the tests import the same function the app runs — which makes a
// revert of the counting rule a change to THIS file, and a change to this file
// fails the assertions rather than passing them.
//
// Pure, and importing nothing but types, because the suite runs in bare node
// with no DOM: the counting has to be testable without rendering a React tree,
// which is precisely the property whose absence let the drift happen.

 * kinds are a human being waited on, but only one is urgent: a permission
 * prompt is a session that cannot proceed until you decide, while an idle
 * prompt is a turn that ended and has not been picked back up — the node is
 * already `done` and says so more quietly two columns away. On the log #348 was
 * measured against the split ran 16 idle to 5 permission, so counting both put
 * roughly three quarters noise into the topbar chip, the tab title and the
 * favicon, which are the three surfaces whose whole value is that they are
 * rare.
 *
 * Idle keeps everything that is not an alarm: its row in the sidebar, its card
 * line, its sort position above running, and CC's verbatim sentence in the
 * tooltip. It just stops shouting.
