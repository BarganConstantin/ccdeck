/** Drop an agent's tool ids out of the two id-keyed maps, for an agent that is

 *  immediately before their `agents.delete`, which is the symmetry `trimTools`
 *  already keeps when it evicts a call out of the per-agent window.
 *
 *  Until #443 neither pruner touched either map, so a call still in flight when
 *  its agent was evicted left an entry nothing could ever reach again: not
 *  `PostToolUse`, whose fallback resurrects from `state.agents` and so needs the
 *  agent to still be there; not either sweep, which both iterate `state.agents`;
 *  not `trimTools`, which only ever runs from its own agent's `PreToolUse`; and
 *  not the garbage collector, because the map held the last strong reference to
 *  a `ToolCall` that still carried its whole `tool_input`. `sweepStaleTools`
 *  rests part of its safety argument on this ("the bubble goes with the agent
 *  when the session is pruned") and the bubble did go — the index entry did not.
 *
 *  Worth doing, but this is tidiness rather than a leak anyone is feeling. To
 *  orphan anything, a pruner has to delete an agent that is `done` while it
 *  still holds an unsettled call, and on Claude the ordinary killed-mid-call
 *  session does not qualify: no `Stop` arrives for it, so it stays `active` and
 *  unprunable until `sweepStaleSessions` reaps it — and `sweepStaleTools` runs
 *  first on the same tick against the same window (#436), so it has already
 *  settled and released those calls by the time the root turns `done`. Replaying
 *  this machine's entire 21-hour events.jsonl with both pruners live evicted 16
 *  agents and orphaned exactly nothing. What is left over is Codex, where the
 *  sweep deliberately abstains (#397) and pruning is therefore the only bound on
 *  a call nobody ever answered the approval prompt for, and the Claude case where
 *  a `PostToolUse` went missing but the `Stop` that ends the agent still landed.
 *  One entry per such call: 244 bytes at this log's median `tool_input`, 8.5 KB
 *  at its p99.
 *
 *  WHY EACH DELETE IS CONDITIONAL RATHER THAN BY ID. A tool id does not belong
 *  to one `ToolCall` object for good. `findTool` consults `toolIndex` first and
 *  the owner's own list only after, so a re-delivered `PreToolUse` for an id that
 *  has already settled finds neither — the index entry went with the settle —
 *  and `resolveOwner` then hands it to whoever the attribution stack names NOW,
 *  which is a different agent whenever a subagent started in between. That pushes
 *  a second `ToolCall` under the same id and re-points both maps at the new
 *  owner, while the first object stays in the old agent's `tools` array. Deleting
 *  by id alone would let the pruning of a long-finished agent quietly evict a

 *  to, `SessionList.buildRows` skips it because it is not a root, so it has no
 *  sidebar row and no cost roll-up, and it floats on the canvas with nothing to
 *  explain it. `pruneDoneSessions` has held the opposite invariant since it was
 *  written — it evicts whole subtrees and has a test asserting no agent is left
 *  pointing at a deleted parent — and this is the same invariant. It is kept the
 *  same way, too: an agent that has children leaves WITH them, so the eviction
 *  order stays "oldest ended first" and a root's departure is never something a
 *  later pass has to finish.
 *
 *  Skipping rather than cascading when a child is NOT a candidate, because that
 *  child is the reason to keep the parent. Everything in `stale` is `done`, but
 *  a subagent can still be `active` under a `done` root — a background Task, or
 *  a `SubagentStop` that was lost — and one inside `graceMs` is still fading out
 *  on screen. Taking the root then would delete the card the user is watching
 *  work, or yank one mid-animation; leaving the whole tree alone costs a pass,
 *  and the pass comes round every 250ms.
 *
 *  The one price is that the cap can undershoot: a tree leaves whole, so

 *  residue is sessions that came back after hours, which no rule here can tell
 *  from a session that is over.
 *
 *  `closedAt` (types.ts) is what makes the two distinguishable, and ordering is
 *  all it is allowed to do. The cap still holds exactly and the count of
 *  evictions per pass is unchanged, so a board of nothing but idle sessions
 *  still settles at `cap` with the oldest going first — which it must, because
 *  absence of `closedAt` means "not known to be closed" and never "still open":

    // alone cannot tell them apart: at any age, a silent call is either a session
    // that died mid-call or a command that is simply still running. Judged on age
    // this sweep guessed "died", and on this machine's log it guessed wrong far
    // more often than right — of the 16 Claude calls it would have stamped failed
    // at the old ninety seconds, 13 went on to return normally (12 `Bash`, one
    // `AskUserQuestion`; longest 776.2s, drawn red and counted as an error for
    // 686.2s of that) and only 3 were genuinely lost. Four in five of its verdicts
    // were false, and a call drawn as failed while it is still working is a lie
    // the user acts on — they go and kill the build the deck says already broke.
    //
    // No threshold on the call's own age can fix that, which is why this is not
    // simply a bigger number. Ninety seconds sat below Claude Code's own Bash
    // timeout (120s default, up to 600s), so the sweep fired inside the CLI's
    // documented operating range; but 600s does not save it either — two of the
    // measured honest calls ran past that, because PreToolUse fires before the
    // permission decision, so a call parked on a human is unbounded in exactly the
    // way #397's Codex approval prompt is. There is no number that is above every
    // legitimate call and below every dead one, because the two overlap.
    //
    // The discriminator that does separate them is a different fact entirely, and
    // it is already on the node: `lastEventAt` (#350) is when this session was
    // last heard from at all. A session still emitting events is alive, so its
    // quiet call is slow; a session that has emitted nothing is the case this
    // sweep was built for. That is the same judgement `sweepStaleSessions` makes
    // one level up, so it is made here on the same clock and the same window
    // rather than on a second, shorter one that contradicts it — the deck used to
    // call a session dead enough to fail its tools at ninety seconds while still
    // calling it alive at ninety minutes.
    //
    // Both halves are load-bearing, and swapping the clock WITHOUT also adopting
    // that window would have fixed nothing. A foreground tool call is the whole of
    // what its session is doing, so the session is silent for the length of the
    // call by construction: all 13 false positives above ran on sessions whose
    // longest silence inside the call window was the call itself (776.2s of call,
    // 769.9s of silence). Read against a ninety-second window, `lastEventAt` would
    // have condemned every one of them exactly as `startedAt` did. What it buys is
    // the case the age clock cannot see at all — a session whose subagents are
    // still reporting is alive no matter how old one of its calls is — and, more
    // than that, it makes the window mean something: ninety minutes is not a
    // bigger guess, it is the number this file already defends for "presumed
    // dead", and this sweep is now asking that question and no other.
    //
    // The direction this is now wrong in is the cheap one. A genuinely lost call
    // stays drawn in-flight until its session goes quiet for the full window
    // instead of settling at ninety seconds — a spinner that lingers rather than a

    // evidence for it. #397 made the same trade for Codex.

 * `endedAt` is stamped at the last event rather than at `now`: that is the last
 * moment there is any evidence the session existed, and it lets the two pruners
 * treat a two-hour-dead session as the oldest thing on the board, which it is.
 * Only `active` agents are settled — an `err` node keeps its error — and the
 * subagents go with the root, since a session nothing has been heard from has no

    // that newer, legitimate subagent stopped. It was not confined to one turn.

    // Clearing is safe on the premise this sweep is built on, and the premise is
    // stronger here than at `Stop`. A subagent doing long work emits its own
    // Pre/PostToolUse under this same session id, and every one of those stamps
    // `lastEventAt` on this root — so a session that reached `maxMs` of TOTAL
    // silence has no subagent still working under it by construction, whatever
    // the stack still says.

    // (#350). A late event puts the ROOT back — `reaped` cleared, `state` active,
    // `endedAt` undone — and deliberately leaves the settled subagents `done`,
    // because a subagent that was mid-flight when its session went quiet is
    // genuinely over and `SubagentStart` is the documented way one comes back.

    // the whole of the resumed session's traffic: exactly the zombie above, now
    // re-created by the recovery path. The stack stays empty, the resumed session
    // attributes to its root, and a subagent that really did survive re-announces
    // itself and is pushed back on by `pushActive` as usual.

    // `changed` is not touched: the stack is attribution state for events that
    // have not arrived yet, and nothing on screen is drawn from it, so removing a
