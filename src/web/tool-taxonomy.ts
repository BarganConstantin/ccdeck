// What a tool IS — its bucket, its emoji, the label the deck writes on the
// bubble — answered once, for both the canvas and the detail panel.
//
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (#417). The deck used to answer that question in six
// separate literals: TOOL_CATEGORY, TOOL_EMOJI, SHELL_TOOLS, CODEX_TOOLS and
// CODEX_PRIMARY_LABEL in ToolBursts.tsx, plus DETAIL_TOOL_CAT in App.tsx, whose
// own comment said the duplication was "kept in sync manually — small enough
// that a shared module isn't worth it". Then Codex started routing its shell
// work through a tool called `exec`, and all six missed it at once: the bubble
// drew as a grey ✨ with the raw name and no sub-bubble, the detail strip
// counted it under "other", and the category chips filed it away from the
// other shell calls. Six edits to fix one rename is six chances to miss one,
// which is precisely what happened, so the Codex half of every table is now
// DERIVED from the single spec table below and a rename costs exactly one line.
//
// The Claude half deliberately stays where it is. Claude's tool names have not
// moved in the life of this project and each table covers a different slice of
// them; hoisting them too would be churn without a bug behind it. What is
// shared here is the part that has actually drifted.

 * within a hair of it — DETAIL_TOOL_CAT was a strict subset, missing only the

 * there is no `in`, no `Object.keys`, no `hasOwnProperty` anywhere against this
 * table, so the eight were eight lines that could not change a rendered pixel.
 * They are gone rather than kept as documentation because DETAIL_TOOL_CAT was
 * already living proof of the cost: it was a copy of this table that omitted
 * exactly these eight, and the deck could not tell the two apart. The names are
 * not forgotten — all eight still carry real emoji in TOOL_EMOJI

/**
 * The command a Codex `exec` script actually runs, dug out of the script.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NEEDED AT ALL. `exec` is not a shell tool that takes a command
 * string; it is a SCRIPT tool, and its input is a small JavaScript program that
 * calls into a `tools.*` API. Every one of the 83 `exec` inputs on this machine
 * is such a program — 83/83 start with `const `, none parses as JSON, all are
 * multi-line, and the median is three lines. Codex's own result wrapper agrees:
 * it prefixes the output with "Script completed" / "Script failed" (#397), not
 * with an exit code.
 *
 * So the obvious fix — hand the whole input to commandStringOf as a command —
 * is wrong in a way that looks right until you see it: parseShellCommand would
 * take the first token of the program and the deck would draw `⚡ Shell → ⚙️
 * const` on every single Codex call. The real command is one level in, as the
 * `cmd` argument of `tools.exec_command({ cmd: "…" })`, which is how 79 of the
 * 84 `tools.*` calls observed are spelled.
 *
 * WHAT THE FALLBACK IS FOR. The other five calls are `tools.apply_patch(…)` and
 * `tools.web__run({ search_query })` — scripts that run no shell command at
 * all. Rather than draw nothing for those, the API method's own name is
 * returned, so the bubble reads `⚡ Shell → ⚙️ web__run` instead of stopping at
 * `⚡ Shell`. A tool the deck cannot fully read should still say what it did.
 *
 * The scan is bounded to the object literal that opens the call — `[^{}]` can
 * cross neither into a nested object nor out of this one — so a `cmd` key
 * belonging to some other call later in the script cannot be mistaken for this
 * one's. Returns null when the input is not a Codex script at all, which is the
 * signal to fall back to the ordinary command-string lookup.
 *
 * Both patterns require the CALL parenthesis rather than settling for the bare
 * `tools.` prefix, and that is not decoration. This runs on any tool_input
 * carrying a `script` key, which includes PowerShell's, and a PowerShell script
 * that so much as mentions `$tools.Count` would otherwise be reported as having
 * run a command named "Count".
