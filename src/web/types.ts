   *  fires when the main agent finishes responding, and the Codex watcher maps

   *  turn (#395) — so `endedAt` on a root means "the last turn finished", which

   *  to type into. `pruneDoneSessions` read it as "this session is over" and
   *  evicted the terminal two minutes into thinking time; the next prompt then
   *  rebuilt it as a brand-new node with no prompt history, no tool history, no
   *  `firstPrompt`, no model, and `startedAt` reset to now. On this machine's
   *  logs (20,864 envelopes, 22 sessions), 223 of 250 `Stop`s were followed by
   *  another turn on the same session and only 89 of those came back inside the
   *  two-minute grace — so for 60% of turn boundaries the deck was holding a
   *  still-open terminal in the eviction queue.
   *
   *  `reaped` is the neighbouring flag and answers a different question: it says
   *  the ENDING was a guess, so a late event can undo it. This one says the
   *  ending was of the session rather than of a turn, so the pruner can prefer a
   *  session that is genuinely over to one that is merely between turns. A
   *  reaped session sets both — the sweep's whole judgement is that the session
   *  is gone — and the un-reap clears both, because an ending that has been
   *  withdrawn was not an ending.
   *
   *  Absence means "not known to be closed", never "still open": a killed CLI
   *  sends no `SessionEnd` and Codex has no such record at all, which is the
   *  same reason the server refuses to use it as a cache-eviction signal. That
   *  is why it only ever ranks the eviction order and never gates it — the cap
   *  still holds exactly, so a board of nothing but idle sessions still settles
   *  at `cap` with the oldest going first.
   *
