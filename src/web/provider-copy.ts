// How the browser NAMES the CLIs it watches. providers.ts holds the fact; this
// holds the words, and derives them from that fact instead of asserting them.
//
// Every string here replaces one that was written when the deck watched a single
// CLI and was never revisited when the second one landed (#404). The worst of
// them was the empty-state hint, which told a Codex user to install hooks: the
// deck stopped installing Codex hooks in the very commit that introduced Codex
// support, `installHooks` throws on that provider now, and the file the copy
// named — ~/.codex/hooks.json — is opened by nothing but the uninstaller. So a
// user whose canvas was empty for one of the three real reasons (started with
// --no-codex, no rollout written yet, CODEX_HOME pointing at another tree)
// hand-wrote a file the deck never reads and then hunted for a trust prompt that
// no longer exists.
//
// The fix is not to soften those sentences until they are true of everything.
// A deck that is not watching Codex can say so — /api/health reports `providers`
// since #402 — and "Codex capture is off" is both true and the one sentence that
// ends the search. Vagueness would have been the other way out and it helps
// nobody: a hint that names no path, no flag and no variable is a hint a user
// cannot act on.
//
// Kept out of App.tsx for the same reason scope.ts and providers.ts are: these
// branches can then be read and tested without rendering React, and the branch
// that matters most is the one nobody exercises by hand — a Codex-only machine.

 * chart below then added them together, so the subtitle promised a distinction
 * the panel refused to make. It was also wrong in a second direction nobody had
 * noticed — ccusage reads sixteen CLIs, not two, so a machine running OpenCode
 * had its spend in that number under a subtitle that denied it existed.
 *
 * So the line is derived, and from the run when there is one. `found` is the
 * agent ids the range actually came back with, which is a MEASUREMENT of whose
 * logs are in the figures on screen; `providers` is what the deck was started
 * to watch, which is a different fact and can honestly disagree — a deck run
 * with `--no-codex` still gets Codex spend out of ccusage, because ccusage
 * reads the logs on the machine rather than the deck's flags.
 *
 * The measurement wins when it exists, and `providers` is the fallback for
 * every state where there is nothing to measure: the first render, a run still
 * going, a run that failed, an empty range, and a ccusage too old to report the
 * split at all. That is the case #402 put `providers` in /api/health for — it
 * is the only thing that can keep a Claude-only machine from being told about
 * Codex, and a Codex-only machine from being told about Claude Code, before any
 * data exists to say otherwise.
 *
 * A deck watching neither CLI names none, for the same reason providerNames
 * returns null there: "local logs" claims nothing that can turn out to be
 * false.

 * The finish-sound toggle's tooltip — including the turns it does NOT cover.
 *
 * This switch is one line in Claude Code's settings.json: a `Stop` hook whose
 * command is notify.js, which Claude Code itself executes at the end of a turn.
 * Nothing about that reaches Codex. The deck installs no Codex hooks — it
 * stopped in the commit that introduced Codex support, because they do not fire
 * reliably on Windows — and reads the rollout JSONL files instead, after the
 * fact. So a Codex user turned this on, watched turn after turn finish in
 * silence, and had nothing anywhere to read it against (#394). An unqualified
 * "Sound on turn finish" is the whole of the problem: the silence is correct
 * behaviour and it is indistinguishable from a broken toggle.
 *
 * Two other endings were available and both were rejected:
 *
 *   - Play it in the browser with Web Audio. The hook plays with no tab open at
 *     all, because it runs on the machine; a tab cannot. It would also be
 *     silent in a tab that has never been clicked, which autoplay policy makes
 *     the normal state of a monitoring deck left in the background — the exact
 *     tab this feature exists for. One switch would then mean two different
 *     promises, and the weaker one only where the user is not looking.
 *
 *   - Spawn notify.js from the server when the rollout watcher emits its
 *     synthetic Codex `Stop` (#395 added that event, so the moment is known
 *     now). Closer, but the switch still would not mean one thing: the Claude
 *     sound is a hook on the machine, so it fires once whether zero decks or
 *     four are running and whatever `--workspace` they were given, while a
 *     server-side sound fires once PER deck tailing that rollout (the
 *     writesCodexLog election that de-dupes the log only runs under --persist),
 *     only inside that deck's workspace, and not at all when no deck is up. And
 *     the switch has nowhere honest to keep its state for a machine that has no
 *     Claude Code: turning it on writes a `Stop` hook into a settings.json for a
 *     CLI that is not installed, which is the class of bug #402 and #404 just
 *     removed. That is a feature with its own design, not this defect.
 *
 * So the toggle stays what it is and says what it is. The sentence names the
 * mechanism, not just the limit, because "Claude Code only" is a fact a user can
 * act on and "sound" alone is not — and it is added only on a machine that has a
 * Codex to be silent about. On a Claude-only machine there is nothing to warn
 * anyone off, and the deck does not draw the button at all without Claude Code.
