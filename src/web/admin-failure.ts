// What the deck says when the server refuses. Three rankings live here, one per
// shape of refusal — explainFailure for /api/claude-accounts/admin, whose free
// text is written for the user, explainCommandFailure below it for the routes
// that hand back a subprocess's own output, and explainCcusageFailure for the
// usage-history modal, whose subprocess is an external CLI the deck installs
// itself and so fails in ways the account routes have no code for.
//
// Two different things come back on an admin refusal and they are not
// interchangeable.
// `reason` is a code for a decision the server made, and the map below is that
// decision said in the product's voice. `detail`/`error` is the text the step
// that actually failed wrote down, and that is the half carrying the remedy:
// `cswap add` unable to read the macOS login keychain because the deck runs as a
// background service, or a `claude` that is not on PATH and the
// AGENTS_DECK_CLAUDE that points at it.
//
// Ranking the map above `error` unconditionally is how those sentences stopped
// reaching anyone. Reason "add_failed" has an entry, so "signed in, but
// claude-swap could not record the account" won every time — and the dialog's
// failure card renders this same string, so the remedy had nowhere else to
// surface and was simply lost.
//
// `error` cannot just win outright either, because it belongs to the login flow
// rather than to this response: a rejected code leaves its sentence on a flow
// that is still alive, so answering the next request out of it would tell
// someone who submitted an empty box that their code was not accepted. A flow
// that is over can no longer collect a newer error, which makes the one it holds
// its account of the ending. So the server's own words win exactly there, and
// the map speaks while the flow is still moving.
//
// Kept out of the components so the rankings can be tested without React or a
// DOM, the same reason login-flow.ts and login-announce.ts live out here.

// resolved to the user's home root, so both shims ran and both died with
//
//     Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\…\node_modules\npm\bin\npx-cli.js'
//     code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'

// `not found`, the underscore is not a space. So it fell through to
// CCUSAGE_REASONS.run_failed — "ccusage could not report usage — try again" —
// and trying again is the one thing that cannot work when the wrong script is
// being loaded. Every retry re-runs the identical spawn for the identical stack.
//
// It gets its own sentence rather than a fifth alternate on NO_NPX because the

// Node's npm/npx; here npx IS on PATH and it launched, so saying "not on this
// deck's PATH" to someone who can see it on their PATH is the kind of wrong
// that makes a reader stop believing the rest.
//
// This sentence has now been wrong twice, and both times for naming a cause on
// the user's machine that was never there.
//
// #432 read the shape as "the machine's npm is damaged" and told a Windows user
// to reinstall Node. Their npm demonstrably worked: they had started the deck
// with `npx ccdeck` moments earlier, and `npm i -g ccdeck` installed twelve
// packages cleanly on the same machine.
//
// #450 then removed the verdict but kept a diagnostic — run `where npx` and
// `npm config get prefix`, and if npx works there, start from a global install
// — built on the theory that the deck had reached the WRONG npx off an
// npx-extended PATH. The same user ran it: `where npx` printed
// `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd` and the prefix was the stock
// `%APPDATA%\npm`. Nothing was wrong with either.
//
// #456 is what it actually was, and it is ours. The deck asked cmd.exe for a
// BARE `npx.cmd`, so the shim's `%~dp0` — where it looks for npx-cli.js — came
// out as the deck's working directory instead of its own:
//
//     Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\vceban\node_modules\npm\bin\npx-cli.js'
//
// `C:\Users\vceban` is where the deck was started from. The deck now hands
// cmd.exe the shim's full path (see shimPath in exec.mjs), so this sentence has
// nothing left to ask the user to check — the remedy is a newer deck. It is
