// Anthropic bills a cache write by the TTL it was written at: 1.25× base
// input for a 5-minute entry, 2× for a 1-hour one. CC writes 1-hour caches
// for the bulk of its prefix, so charging the whole of
// `cache_creation_input_tokens` at the 5-minute rate — which this file used
// to do — under-reported every Claude session by 5-10% and disagreed with

// transcript carries the split; costForUsage documents what happens to
// tokens that reach us without one.

// THE `(?![-_.]\d{1,7}(?!\d))` ON EVERY CLAUDE ROW (#688). It is one assertion
// repeated nine times rather than a shared constant, because the row patterns
// have to stay regex LITERALS — bedrock-model-ids.test.ts reads them straight
// out of this source and rebuilds them, so that a row added tomorrow with no
// pinned id fails its coverage sweep instead of quietly going unproven. A table
// assembled by string concatenation would be invisible to that check.
//
// What it asserts is not what `\b` asserts. `\b` says the version number ended.
// This says nothing that follows it is ANOTHER version number — and the gap
// between the two questions is the whole of #688. `^claude[-_]opus[-_]4(?:[-_.]1)?\b`
// reads `claude-opus-4-9` by taking the EMPTY branch of its optional `.1` and
// finding a boundary between the `4` and the `-`, so an Opus 4.9 nobody has
// priced yet was billed at the RETIRED Opus 4 rate: $15/$75 against the current
// tier's $5/$25, three times the real spend, printed as a confident figure with
// nothing on screen to say it was invented. `claude-opus-4-10` got there the
// same way — it tries `-1`, fails the boundary between `1` and `0`, backtracks,
// and settles on the bare `4`. The bare Sonnet 4 row swallowed `claude-sonnet-4-7`
// and everything above it identically; that one costs nothing today only because
// Sonnet 4 and 4.5/4.6 happen to share a price, which is a coincidence and not a
// guarantee. The gpt-5 row three hundred lines down already refuses exactly this
// guess in its own words, and this is that argument with the multiplier the other
// way up: an unrecognised model must reach NO row, so every surface prints
// UNPRICED_LABEL beside a real token count.
//
// WHY A DIGIT-RUN LENGTH AND NOT THE OBVIOUS `(?![-_.]\d)`. Refusing every digit
// that follows the version would refuse the commonest tail a Claude id has:
// `claude-opus-4-20250514` is Bedrock's Opus 4 and `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` is
// first-party Opus 4.1, both live ids pinned in bedrock-model-ids.test.ts, and
// both would have stopped pricing altogether — a fix that quietly unprices a
// real model is worse than the bug it closes. The only all-digit token that
// legitimately follows a version here is the eight-digit release date, so the
// rule is drawn on length: a run SHORTER than a date is another version, and
// this row does not know it. Vertex's `@20250805`, Bedrock's `-v1:0` revision
// and CC's `[1m]` banner all start on a character `[-_.]` does not accept, so
// none of them is affected either way.
//
// `rates` is either a fixed table entry or a function of the current time, for
// the handful of models whose published price changes on a known date.
