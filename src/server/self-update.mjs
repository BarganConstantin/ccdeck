// Tells the deck when the code it is executing is no longer the code on disk.
//
// Node caches every module at import. A deck that was already running when
// `npm i -g agents-deck` replaced its files keeps executing the OLD code until
// the process restarts — and nothing says so. The terminal banner still prints
// the version it booted with, and the browser's __APP_VERSION__ is baked into
// whichever bundle it happened to load, so the UI can even show the NEW number
// while the server runs the old one.
//
// That is not theoretical. On 2026-08-12 a deck left running from before
// v1.30.4 kept spawning `claude --print /usage` once a minute, burning the
// whole hourly usage-endpoint budget and 429-ing claude-swap, while the fix sat
// unused on disk. The user had no way to see it.
//
// So we report three distinct versions:
//   running   — captured at boot by the caller, before an upgrade can land
//   installed — re-read from disk per call; what a restart would run
//   latest    — npm's dist-tag, fetched at most once an hour (CHECK_MS below,
//               which also explains why it is not the daily cadence it was)
//
// Installing is opt-in and narrow. `npm i -g` runs only when the user asks for
// it by name and only where it can actually work: a global install, on a
// directory we can write, outside a git checkout and outside an npx cache.
// Everywhere else this stays what it has always been — a printed command.

// waited for one check to settle and then asked again got a fresh
// `https://registry.npmjs.org/…/dist-tags` every time. Reads on this server are
// deliberately open — `isTrustedRead` does not apply the `Sec-Fetch-Site` test
// that `isTrustedMutation` does, because a cross-site read of
// `http://127.0.0.1:4317` is an ordinary top-level navigation — so

//     })();
//
// from any page the user had open was one registry request per turn, as fast as
// the round trip allows, and every so often two of them: `runCheck` confirms a
// tag it has not seen before against the version document. The requests are
// small — the whole reason the dist-tags endpoint is used here rather than the
// packument — but they leave the user's address, carrying the user-agent this
// deck sets, and they are aimed at a third party rather than at the machine the
// loop is running on. That makes it #580's shape with the cost pointed
// outwards, which if anything is the worse direction.
//
// Nothing above this line was going to stop it. The hour is written to a marker
// FILE, and `force` walks past it; `first` walks past it too; and on a machine
// where `~/.agents-deck` cannot be written `writeMarker` swallows the failure,
// so `checkDue` sees "never checked" on every single call and the hour is not
// really there at all.
//
// So the floor sits under all of it, in this process's own memory, between the
// last rule that admitted a check and the request it admitted. It is quota.mjs's
// number and codex-quota.mjs's and codex-usage.mjs's — the five routes in this

 *
 * Both halves of the old spelling were wrong on Windows and only one of them
 * bites today.
 *
 * The one that bites: a `.cmd` shim locates its payload relative to `%~dp0`,
 * the drive and path of the command token cmd.exe was handed, and a BARE
 * `npm.cmd` carries no directory — so `%~dp0` came out as the deck's working
 * directory and npm's shim went looking for `node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js`
 * underneath it. A user with a global install, deck started from
 * `C:\Users\vceban`, clicks Update now and npm dies with `Cannot find module
 * 'C:\Users\vceban\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js'` — on a machine whose npm
 * is perfectly healthy, and where typing the same command at the same prompt
 * works. shimPath is the answer, and `?? "npm.cmd"` keeps a layout it cannot see
 * exactly as well off as it was.
 *
 * The one that does not, yet: `shell: true` makes Node join file and args with
 * single spaces and no quoting. These arguments contain no spaces, so it has
 * never mattered here — but it is the #362 defect sitting one argument away, and
 * spawnSpec removes it by quoting every token into the cmd.exe line.
 *
 * POSIX is untouched: `npm` there is a real executable, isBatch is false, and
 * the vector goes to spawn exactly as it always has.
 *
 * Exported for tests: the platform is a parameter so the Windows command line
 * can be checked from any OS, and `deps` stands in for the Windows filesystem
 * the shim lookup asks about. The same shape ccusage.mjs's installSpec has.

// The npx upgrade is the one path whose failure the server cannot see. It runs
// in the SUPERVISOR, after this process has already exited: the worker asks to
// come back through `npx -y <spec>@latest`, npx fails, and the supervisor
// relaunches the copy on disk. The new worker boots knowing nothing, so
// /api/version kept answering `upgrade: {state:"idle"}` — the banner still
// offered "Update & restart", the tab said nothing at all, and a user who
// clicked the button without watching the terminal saw the deck blink and come
// back unchanged. Every click then repeated the whole cycle identically.
//
// A file is the only channel between the two processes: the supervisor writes
// one when the relaunch fails, and the worker it starts instead reads it here.
// Same directory as the update markers, and named after the package for the
// same reason they are.
//
// The package name alone was not enough, and one release was enough to show it.
// Two `npx ccdeck` decks resolve into the same content-addressed _npx directory,
// so they run the same package at the same version out of the same home: when
// one user's upgrade failed, the other deck — which had never asked for
// anything — read that note as its own, reported `upgrade: {state:"failed"}`
// and labelled its first ever click "Retry update". The version-staleness rule
// below cannot catch it, because both decks are the same version.
//
// So the name carries WHOSE failure it is as well as which package's: the pid
// of the supervisor that wrote it. That is unique among the decks alive on the
// machine, and it crosses the process boundary on its own — the worker that
// reads the note is a child the supervisor spawns after the failure, and
// inherits the pid through AGENTS_DECK_SUPERVISOR_PID. A worker with no
