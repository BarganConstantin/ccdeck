/**
 * What an alias may be made of.
 *
 * Every other argument this module sends to cswap is an integer bounded to
 * 1..999; the alias was the one free-text field, and `.trim()` was the whole of
 * its validation. That is fine on POSIX, where `run` spawns the argument vector
 * untouched, and not fine on Windows: cswap is a `.cmd` shim there, so the
 * vector goes through `cmd.exe /d /s /c` (see viaCmd). Quote-doubling handles
 * `"` and every other metacharacter, which leaves exactly the residual exec.mjs
 * documents — `%VAR%` expands inside quotes and a command line has no escape for
 * it — so `%USERPROFILE%` in an alias stored the user's home path, and an alias
 * carrying an unbalanced quote plus an `&` could end the quoted region early.
 * An interior newline survived `.trim()` untouched as well.
 *
 * The same allowlist discipline cswap-auto.mjs already applies to its model
 * list, and it closes the unbounded-length half too: an alias is a short name
 * shown instead of an email, so 64 characters is not a constraint anyone meets
 * by accident.

 * What a `cswap move` actually did, read out of the store rather than its words.
 *
 * The panel needs two facts to keep its manage block pointed at the account
 * the user opened it on: which slot that account ended up in, and whether a
 * second account was displaced to make room. `cswap move` does carry both, but
 * not in a line this code can take: a swap prints "Swapped Account 2 and
 * Account 3:" and then one indented roster line per account, and `firstUseful`
 * takes the LAST line of a command's output — right for every other cswap
 * command, and here it hands back "3: someone@example.com" instead of the
 * verdict. The store is the fact, for the same reason `newSlot` reads it after
 * an add rather than parsing what add printed.
 *
 * Claude-swap has three cases — the account is already there, the target slot
 * is free and it relocates, the target is occupied and the two trade places —
 * and all three are legible in what settled: the mover holds the target, and
 * on a swap the occupant holds the slot the mover left. `to` is null when the
 * account is not where it was sent, which is not a case that should happen and
 * is exactly why it is reported rather than assumed.
