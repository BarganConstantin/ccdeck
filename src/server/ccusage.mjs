 * The deck has been telling people "put ccusage on PATH yourself" in
 * admin-failure.ts for as long as that sentence has existed, and nothing
 * anywhere ever looked: a user who did exactly what they were told, and could
 * prove it with `ccusage --version` in their own shell, got the identical

 * delete the promise. It is kept because there is a configuration that needs it
 * and has no other:
 *
 *   - `AGENTS_DECK_NO_INSTALL=1` is documented as "never install or update
 *     claude-swap / ccusage". Someone who sets it AND installs ccusage
 *     themselves has done the only thing that flag can sensibly mean, and until
 *     now the deck answered "ccusage is not installed" while it was installed
 *     and on their PATH. There was NO combination of settings that made a
 *     self-managed ccusage work.
 *   - The #432 machine — npm and npx both unusable on disk — cannot create the
 *     managed install and cannot run the npx fallback. A copy the user already
 *     has is the only route left, and it was the one route the deck refused to
 *     look down.
 *
 * The override wins over PATH the way AGENTS_DECK_CSWAP does over cswap's own
 * search, and is never remembered, because somebody debugging a bad resolution
 * needs a change to it to take effect on the next click rather than the next
 * restart. Nothing here is cached for the same reason, and it is affordable:
 * a lookup is a handful of stats, once per uncached fetch, against a process
 * spawn that follows it.

 * reads — before it prints anything. The deck then drew that single number under
 * a subtitle naming two CLIs, so "how much of this is Codex?" had no answer
 * anywhere on the panel (#431).
 *
 * Measured against ccusage 20.0.20 rather than read off its README, because the
 * whole reason to send this is what comes back. Two runs over the same range,
 * with and without it, differ in exactly one way: each day gains an `agents`
 * array, one entry per CLI, carrying that CLI's own `totalCost`, token counts
 * and `modelBreakdowns`. Every key the parser below already reads survives byte
 * for byte, the day's `totalCost` is unchanged and still equals the sum of its
 * agents, the day count is the same and `totals` is untouched. The flag is
 * purely additive, which is what makes it safe to send unconditionally: the
 * merged view the deck has always drawn stays available for free, and a browser
 * that ignores `agents` sees the reply it has always seen.

 * already has in hand, for one reason: a version table only knows about the
 * ccusage versions that existed when it was written, and two of the three
 * runners here are copies the deck did not install and cannot date — an
 * AGENTS_DECK_CCUSAGE override and whatever is on PATH. Retrying degrades
 * correctly for ANY unknown ccusage rather than only for old ones.
 *
 * The retry is narrow, because a second attempt is a second process and on a
 * genuinely broken machine that is a second wait. It fires only when the CLI
 * itself failed — an untagged error, which is this module's word for "the child
 * exited non-zero, or never started" — and never for the four failures that are
 * already understood: `timeout` (where a retry would cost another 90 seconds
 * for nothing), `no_install` and `bad_override` (thrown before any process
 * runs), and `bad_output` (thrown after a run that ccusage considered a
 * success, so the flag was accepted). An old ccusage lands squarely in the
 * untagged case: measured, it exits 2 with an empty stdout and
 * `Unknown option '--by-agent'` on stderr, which is unambiguous — it cannot be
 * confused with a successful run that happened to have no data.
 *
 * When the retry ALSO fails, its failure is the one that travels, not the first
 * one. Both runs failed, and the one without the deck's flag on it is the
 * honest account of this machine: reporting the first would blame a flag that
 * has just been shown to make no difference. Nothing is remembered in that case
 * either, so the split is asked for again on the next attempt.
 *
 * The retry is therefore broad and the MEMORY of it is narrow — see
 * blamesByAgent. Those are different questions with different costs: guessing
 * wrong about whether to retry costs one process on a machine that is already
 * failing, and guessing wrong about whether to remember costs the split for the
