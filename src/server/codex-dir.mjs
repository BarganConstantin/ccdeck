// Where OpenAI Codex lives on this machine: its home directory, its rollout
// tree, the walk over that tree and the session id a rollout's file name
// carries — the Codex-side mirror of claude-dir.mjs.
//
// CODEX_HOME relocates ~/.codex wholesale, exactly as CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR does on
// the Claude side, and five modules used to answer the question for themselves
// in three different spellings (#375):
//
//   index.mjs        CODEX_HOME ? resolve(CODEX_HOME) : join(homedir(), ".codex")
//   installer.mjs    the same
//   codex-usage.mjs  CODEX_HOME ? CODEX_HOME         : join(homedir(), ".codex")
//   codex-auth.mjs   CODEX_HOME ?? join(homedir(), ".codex")
//   codex-quota.mjs  the same
//
// The three spellings disagree on two inputs that a shell profile produces by
// accident rather than by intent, and both disagreements are silent:
//
//   CODEX_HOME=""    — what `export CODEX_HOME=$SOME_UNSET_VAR` leaves behind.
//     `??` only falls back on null and undefined, so the two modules spelled
//     that way kept the empty string and then joined onto it: join("",
//     "auth.json") is "auth.json", a CWD-RELATIVE path. codex-auth.mjs is the
//     module that writes the rotated OpenAI refresh token back to disk, and
//     OpenAI rotates that token single-use — so writing it to whatever
//     directory the deck happened to be started from does not merely lose a
//     read, it burns the credential and costs the user a `codex login`.
//
//   CODEX_HOME=./relative — kept verbatim by three of the five, so the tree
//     they read was resolved against the CWD at the moment of each readdir()
//     rather than once at startup. Two modules therefore read a different
//     directory than the other three whenever the deck was started from
//     anywhere but the parent of that relative path.
//
// This module is the single answer to all of it, and every reader now imports
// it. The rule is the `resolve()` + truthiness form index.mjs and installer.mjs
// already used, because it is the one the installer writes against and the one
// that treats an empty value as "not set" — see codexHome() for why that is the
// right way round rather than merely the majority.

/**
 * Absolute path of the Codex home directory: $CODEX_HOME or ~/.codex.
 *
 * WHY AN EMPTY VALUE FALLS BACK. An empty environment variable is not a path.
 * It is what a shell leaves behind when the variable it was assigned from does
 * not exist, and treating it as "the current directory" turns a typo in a
 * profile into a deck that reads and WRITES Codex state in whatever directory
 * it was launched from. Falling back to ~/.codex is the only reading that can
 * be right by accident; there is no user who means "put my Codex credentials in
 * $PWD" and spells it by leaving the variable empty.
 *
 * WHY IT IS TRIMMED. Same argument one step further: `CODEX_HOME=" "` is the
 * same accident with a stray space in the profile line, and claudeConfigDir()
 * has trimmed for exactly this reason since it was written. Trimming only ever
 * removes leading and trailing whitespace, so a real path that CONTAINS spaces
 * — `/Users/me/Library/Application Support/codex` — is untouched, which is the
 * case worth protecting on macOS and Windows both.
 *
 * WHY resolve() AND NOT realpath(). resolve() makes a relative value absolute
 * once, here, instead of leaving every later readdir() to resolve it against
 * whatever the CWD is by then. It deliberately does NOT follow symlinks:
 * ~/.codex is often a link into a dotfiles repo or an encrypted volume, and
 * canonicalising it would (a) require the directory to already exist, which it
 * does not before the first `codex login`, and (b) make the deck rename over
 * the link's target instead of through the link — the very thing codex-auth.mjs
 * resolves symlinks at WRITE time to avoid. A symlinked CODEX_HOME therefore
 * stays spelled the way the user spelled it, on purpose.
 *
 * The environment, home directory and platform are parameters purely so this
 * rule can be checked for a machine the author is not sitting at: the Windows
 * answer — drive letters, backslashes, a trailing `\` — is only ever verifiable
 * from a POSIX box if the path flavour follows the argument rather than the
 * host, the same trick exec.mjs and claudeCliCandidates() already use. Every
 * caller in the deck passes nothing and gets the real machine's answer.
