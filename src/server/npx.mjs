// How to run npx from a supervisor that cannot afford npx to be broken.
//
// The supervisor's upgrade path is `npx -y <spec>@latest`, and it used to
// resolve npx by bare name — `npx.cmd` on Windows — letting the OS find it on
// PATH. That trusts a batch shim to be sitting in a real npm install root,
// because the shim computes everything else from its own directory:
//
//   SET "NPX_CLI_JS=%~dp0\node_modules\npm\bin\npx-cli.js"
//   SET "NPM_PREFIX_JS=%~dp0\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-prefix.js"
//
// Reported from a Windows machine on Node 24 where `%~dp0` was the user's home
// directory and no `node_modules\npm` existed under it. Clicking
// "Update & restart" printed a raw MODULE_NOT_FOUND stack trace and came back
// on the same version.
//
// The cause was guessed at here as "an npm global prefix pointed somewhere the
// shim did not follow", and #456 established it was not: `%~dp0` was the DECK'S
// WORKING DIRECTORY, because a shim asked for by bare name has no directory in
// its `%0` to be the drive-and-path of. Nothing about that machine's npm was
// wrong. The correction lives in shimPath in exec.mjs, and the shim fallback
// below now asks for the full path.
//
// Node ships npm, so npx's real entry point can be reached from
// `process.execPath` with no PATH lookup, no batch file, and no shim-relative
// arithmetic. That is what this prefers. The shim stays as the fallback for
// installs whose npm lives somewhere else entirely, and it still goes through
// spawnSpec — the cmd.exe quoting there is load-bearing and unchanged.
//
// The pre-flight fetch below goes through the very same launcher, for the same
// reason stated the other way round: a supervisor that cannot afford npx to be
// broken cannot afford to discover that it is only after it has stopped
// serving. So the fetch happens first, and only a fetch that worked costs the
// deck its listener.

/**
 * Where npm's own `npx-cli.js` sits relative to the running Node binary, most
 * likely first. Pure: the platform and the executable path are parameters, so
 * the Windows layout can be checked from any OS.
 *
 * Windows keeps npm beside node.exe (`C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\npm`,
 * and the same shape under nvm-windows). POSIX puts it in a `lib` next to the
 * `bin` — usually the parent (`/usr/local/bin/node` →
 * `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm`, as for nvm, fnm and Volta), but not
 * always: Homebrew's node lives in `/usr/local/Cellar/node/<v>/bin` while its
 * npm stays at the prefix, four levels up. So the `lib` spelling is tried at
 * each of the first four ancestors rather than only at the parent. Every
 * candidate is confirmed by the exact file existing, so a wider search cannot
 * pick something that is not npm.
 *
 * The path arithmetic is done on the string rather than through `node:path`,
 * for the same reason npxRoot in self-update.mjs does: `path` here is the
 * platform running the SUITE, so a Windows layout checked from macOS would come
 * back with forward slashes and a `..` nothing resolves.

 * which either binds the port the running one holds or, worse, does not, and

 *
 * `--package` is the half that installs; `--call` is the half that runs, and
 * pointing it at a shell builtin is what makes the install the only effect. The
 * spec never appears as a positional argument, so no bin of ours is ever named,
 * let alone started.
 *
 * `exit 0` rather than anything more informative on purpose: npm runs the call
 * through its script shell — `sh -c` on POSIX, cmd.exe on Windows — and both
 * spell that builtin the same way. Anything that needed a program on PATH would
 * fail exactly where PATH is broken, which is the environment from #184 this
 * pre-flight most needs to answer honestly.
