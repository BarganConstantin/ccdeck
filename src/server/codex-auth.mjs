// Codex (ChatGPT) OAuth credentials: read, refresh, persist.
//
// Ports the flow the Codex CLI itself uses (openai/codex, crate `codex-login`)
// so agents-deck keeps a live token instead of going dark the moment the one
// written by `codex login` rotates server-side.
//
// The important subtlety: OpenAI ROTATES the refresh token, single-use. A
// refresh whose result does not reach disk burns the credential outright —
// the next attempt fails with `refresh_token_reused` and the user has to run
// `codex login` again. Everything defensive in this file follows from that:
// refreshes are serialized, the token is re-read from disk inside the lock
// immediately before it is spent, a response that does not clearly carry a
// new access token is never treated as success, and nothing here throws —
// a rejected promise from a background poll would take the server down.

// rotated refresh token below is single-use, so a write that lands in whatever

/**
 * Write auth.json back atomically: write a sibling tmp file, fsync it, then

 * the fsync means a machine crash cannot leave an empty one behind after we
 * have already spent the old refresh token.
 *
 * Resolves symlinks first — `~/.codex/auth.json` is often a link into a
 * dotfiles repo or an encrypted volume, and renaming onto the link would
 * replace it with a regular file, quietly detaching the user's setup. That
 * resolution is the installer's resolveWriteTarget rather than a bare realpath
 * here, because settings.json needed the identical rule (#673) and a rule
 * written twice is a rule that drifts: the shared one also follows a DANGLING
 * link to the file it names, which a realpath cannot answer at all and which is
 * exactly the state a dotfiles repo is in before its first apply.
 *
 * The temp file comes from the installer's createTemp, which numbers every
 * write and creates it with O_EXCL, rather than from a name built out of the
 * pid alone. A pid names a process, not a write, so that name was one file
 * shared by every write this process makes, and the open that filled it
 * truncated whatever it found: a second refresh in flight would fill it from
 * offset zero underneath the first, and the loser would rename a splice of the
 * two over auth.json — or find its temp file already renamed away and throw
 * ENOENT. What is left at that name between runs is a live rotated refresh
 * token in cleartext, so the leftover a crashed deck strands there is not inert
 * either: a plain create adopts it whole, keeping its permissions, because
 * open() applies the mode it is given only when it is the call that creates the
 * file. O_EXCL turns a taken name into an error the caller handles instead,
 * which is also what makes the 0600 binding from the very first byte rather
 * than whatever the file it inherited happened to allow.
 *
 * The rename is the installer's retrying one because Windows fails it outright
 * with EPERM/EBUSY while another process holds auth.json open, and a virus
 * scanner, the search indexer or the Codex CLI itself does exactly that for a
 * few milliseconds at a time. Everywhere else that costs a re-download; here
 * the refresh token has already been spent server-side, so losing that
 * millisecond race logs the user out of Codex until they run `codex login`.
 *
 * Throws on failure; the caller must treat that as "the refresh did not
 * happen" rather than swallowing it.
