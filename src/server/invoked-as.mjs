// Which of the three published commands the user typed — and nothing else.
//
// The deck is on npm three times over — `ccdeck`, `agents-deck` and `agent-dag`
// — and since #340 all three are literally the same tarball, published with
// `name` set to each in turn. Every surface a human reads says ccdeck now, and
// most of the downloads are still on the other two, so nothing closes that split
// on its own. This file is the evidence behind saying so — once in the terminal,
// once in the browser.
//
// Two rules make that safe, and they are the whole of the file.
//
// It is never a refusal. A build that declined to boot under an old name would
// take the self-update path down with it: a user on `agents-deck` clicks
// "Update & restart", the copy that arrives refuses to run, and the deck is
// dead on the one machine where the deck was the thing that would have
// explained why.
//
// And it is never asked of the PACKAGE. That was unarguable while ccdeck was a
// stub — it depended on `agents-deck` and spawned its bin, so "is this build
// agents-deck?" was true inside every ccdeck run, and a notice keyed on it would
// have scolded exactly the people who did what we asked. #340 removed the stub
// and the rule outlived it, because the three names are now ONE tarball: asking
// the package what it is gets you whichever name the publish step happened to
// set last, which is not evidence about the user at all. The question is which
// name the USER TYPED. That is a different question, with a different answer,
// and on one platform with no answer at all:
//
//   npx, everywhere — npm writes the literal spec into
//     `_npx/<hash>/package.json` as `_npx.packages`, which npxRestartSpec
//     already reads to decide what a restart re-runs. Reused rather than
//     re-derived; the only difference here is that this caller has no fallback
//     to offer, since a guess is the one answer it must not give.
//
//   a global install on macOS or Linux — npm links <prefix>/bin/<name> at the
//     package's bin/agent-dag.js, and node does not resolve that symlink for
//     argv[1]. All three names reach one file and only argv[1] tells them
//     apart, so its last segment is the command that was typed. Verified with
//     npm's own layout: a symlink named `ccdeck` gives argv[1] `…/bin/ccdeck`.
//
//   a global install on Windows — nowhere. npm writes <name>.cmd, <name>.ps1
//     and an extensionless sh shim, each of which runs
//     `node "…\node_modules\<pkg>\bin\agent-dag.js" %*` (npm's cmd-shim).
//     The typed name is the shim's FILENAME and never becomes an argument, and
//     there is no other carrier — npm_config_user_agent and friends are not set
//     for a direct bin invocation. So Windows answers null.
//
//   a git checkout — nothing was typed. `node bin/agent-dag.js` is not any of
//     the three names.
//
// Which leaves the callers one rule: positive identification, or silence. A
// notice shown to somebody who already types `ccdeck` is worse than a notice
// missed, because it is the failure that teaches everyone to ignore the next
// one.
