// Which of the running decks writes an event to the log they share?
//
// The hook already answers that for the events it delivers: it groups the decks
// it is about to post to by the log file each one names in its discovery record,
// elects one per file, and marks the request to every other one `?persist=0`.
// See electWriters in hook/hook.js.
//
// The Codex rollout watcher never goes through the hook — it builds its events
// inside the server by tailing ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl — so nothing
// suppressed the copies on that path: every deck tailing the same rollout
// appended its own line to the one events.jsonl they all default to, so each
// Codex tool call, prompt and session start landed there once per running deck.
// That is the duplication the hook election was added to end, still open on the
// path that is the only Codex capture there is on Windows, where Codex hooks
// never fire at all.
//
// So the server runs the same election, over the same discovery records, with
// the same tie-break. The rule is repeated here rather than imported from
// hook/hook.js because that file is copied out of the package and run standalone
// by the host CLI, with no path back to the module it came from — the same
// reason it re-derives the Claude config dir inline. The two copies are pinned
// equal by a test, as challengeProof's pair already is.

 * one file read as two files, which is the exact thing `bin/deck.js`'s comment
 * over this value says must not happen. On Windows it needs no odd user action:
 * `claudeConfigDir()` derives from `homedir()`, and a shell whose `USERPROFILE`
 * is 8.3-shortened yields a different default string than one with the long
 * form. `subst` and mapped drives and junctions do it too, and on macOS so does
 * `/tmp` against `/private/tmp`.
 *
 * What it cost was not merely a duplicate group. BOTH decks were then elected,
 * so every hook event was appended twice — the duplicate-tools-after-restart
 * symptom the election exists to end — and `logSharing()` compares the same
 * string, so both answered `mine: true` and `POST /api/clear` truncated a file
 * this deck does not own. That is the #698 history loss the ownership gate was
 * added to prevent.
 *
 * THE DIRECTORY IS CANONICALISED EVEN WHEN THE FILE IS NOT THERE, which is the
 * half a plain realpath misses. On a first run, or against a `--history` naming
 * a file the deck will create, `realpath` throws ENOENT — and falling back to
 * the resolved string would leave the two spellings different for exactly the
 * run that creates the file. The parent exists (or is about to be created under
 * one canonical name), so it is canonicalised and the basename rejoined.
 *
 * `canonicalWorkspace` in index.mjs is the same rule for the other path this
 * deck publishes, with three comments naming 8.3 expansion as its reason. This

// ─── Appending one whole line ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The election above decides WHICH deck writes a line. This decides HOW, and
// the two are answers to the same question: the log is one file that several
// processes append to, so a line that arrives in pieces is a line another
// writer can land inside.
//
// What was wrong. events.jsonl was appended with `fsPromises.appendFile`, which
// is not one write(2). Node's writeFileHandle loops over the payload in chunks
// of kWriteFileMaxChunkSize — 512 KiB — awaiting each one, so any line longer
// than 524288 bytes became two or more separate appends with the event loop
// free in between. Measured here, on Node 26 / macOS 15 / APFS, by watching the
// file grow while one 5 MiB appendFile was in flight: it arrived in exactly ten
// steps of 524288 bytes. A single handle.write of the same payload arrived in
// one step of 5242880.
//
// That is reachable in ordinary use. `POST /api/event` accepts a body up to
// 5,000,000 characters, and a PostToolUse carrying a large Read or Bash
// response is routinely a good fraction of that. The event that gets spliced
// into the middle is nearly always this deck's own: pushEvent kicks off
// maybeResolveUsage / maybeResolveModel / maybeResolveContext on the same call,
// and each of those pushes its own event a moment later. Reproduced at 8/8 runs
// with one 1 MiB line and eight small ones issued in one tick, and 4/4 runs
// across two processes appending 3 MiB lines to one file.
//
// The damage is silent and doubled: the oversized event is torn into two
// unparseable halves AND the small event that landed between them is swallowed
// inside one of those halves, so a boot replay loses both.
//
// What this does instead: exactly one write(2) per line, on a descriptor opened
// O_APPEND. That is the primitive the atomicity rests on, so it is worth
// stating exactly what each platform promises.
//
//   Linux — a write to a regular file holds the inode's i_rwsem for the whole
//   call, so one write(2) is atomic against every other writer regardless of
//   size, up to MAX_RW_COUNT (~2 GiB) after which the call returns short.
//   O_APPEND additionally makes the seek-to-end and the write one step, which
//   is what stops two processes overwriting each other's tail.
//
//   macOS — measured, not assumed, because the guarantee is not written down as
//   plainly: single writes of 1 MiB and 5 MiB in-process, and 3 MiB from two
//   processes at once, produced no torn line in any run, while appendFile of
//   the same payloads tore in every run.
//
//   Windows — libuv issues the append as a WriteFile at the documented
//   end-of-file offset on a handle opened FILE_APPEND_DATA, which NTFS serialises
//   per call. This is the platform where the Codex rollout watcher is the only
//   capture path there is, so it is also the platform with the most decks
//   sharing one log.
//
// Where the guarantee does NOT hold: any filesystem that can return a short
// write — NFS and some network/FUSE mounts under memory pressure, and any
// platform once the payload passes its per-call ceiling. The loop below then
// issues a second write for the remainder, and another writer can land between
// them. Nothing available in userland fixes that, so the answer is the reader:
// replayLog skips a line it cannot parse, counts it, and says so, rather than
// stopping at it. A torn line costs one event, not the rest of the file.
//
// Why not cap or drop oversized events instead. The 5 MB ceiling is already the
// cap, and it is enforced where it belongs — at ingest, with a 413 the poster
// can see. Refusing to persist an event the deck is happily drawing would make
// the canvas and its own replay disagree, which is the bug this fixes wearing a
// different hat.
//
// Why the file is opened per line rather than kept open. maybeRotatePersistFile
// renames events.jsonl to events.jsonl.1 at 50 MB and `/api/clear` truncates it
// to zero; a descriptor held across either would go on filling the file nobody
// reads any more. Opening per line is also exactly the syscall count appendFile
// already paid — open, write, close — minus the extra writes.
