// Toggle for the "play a sound when the turn finishes" Stop hook.
//
// Hand-written versions of this hook are almost always one OS-specific
// command — `afplay …` on macOS, a PowerShell one-liner on Windows — ending in
// `|| true`. Each is a silent no-op on every other machine, so a settings.json
// synced across devices ends up with several of them stacked, none of which
// work everywhere. This installs a single entry pointing at notify.js, which
// picks its own player at run time.
//
// Only ever touches its own entry, tagged `__agent-dag-sound`. Hooks the user
// wrote themselves are left exactly as found — including the platform-specific
// ones this replaces, which are reported rather than deleted.
//
// Claude Code only, and deliberately: everything here is one entry in Claude
// Code's settings.json, which Claude Code alone reads and executes. There is no
// Codex equivalent — the deck installs no Codex hooks and tails the rollout
// files instead — so a Codex turn ends in silence and no amount of writing to
// this file changes that. The browser is where that is said rather than
// guessed: the topbar button is drawn only where Claude Code is, and its
// tooltip names the limit and the mechanism behind it. If this module ever does
// learn a second provider, src/web/provider-copy.ts's finishSoundTitle is the
// sentence that has to move with it, and finish-sound-scope.test.ts fails until
// it does (#394).
