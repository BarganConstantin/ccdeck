 * quotes the executable:
 *
 *     "C:\Users\dorin\.local\bin\cswap.exe" auto

 * produce it. A pattern that wanted whitespace immediately after `cswap.exe`
 * saw a `"` there and answered no, for every one of them.
 *
 * The deck's own spawns are the same shape from the other side: viaCmd in
 * src/server/exec.mjs launches a `.cmd` shim as
 * `cmd.exe /d /s /c ""C:\…\cswap.cmd" "auto" "--once""`, with the whole line
 * wrapped in one more pair of quotes because that is what `cmd /c` wants.
 * Treating `"` as a separator takes both apart with no parser and no knowledge
 * of which launcher wrote the line — the outer pair, the per-argument pairs and
 * the bare case all collapse to the same token list.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is respect a quoted path containing spaces:
 * `"C:\Program Files\cswap\cswap.exe" auto` splits into three tokens rather than
 * two. That costs nothing here — the tail token is still `cswap.exe` followed by
