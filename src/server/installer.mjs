 * The `command` string Claude Code stores for our forwarder, and runs THROUGH A

 * The settings.json hook format is a string, not an argv, so this is one of the
 * two places in the codebase that has to build a shell command line by hand —
 * see shellQuoteArg, which is where the escaping rules and their one Windows
 * residual are written down.
 *
 * It used to wrap both paths in double quotes, which on POSIX escapes nothing:
 * `$(…)`, a backtick and `\` are all still live inside them. Both paths come
 * from outside — `installedHookPath` is built from $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (resolved,
 * never validated) or homedir(), and `node` is process.execPath — so a config
 * dir called `/tmp/a$(id)b` was shell code, written into the user's own settings
 * file and executed on every hook fire for as long as it stayed there. The
 * quieter half of the same bug cost nothing but the feature: an ordinary `$` in
 * a path expanded to nothing, the hook pointed at a file that was not there, and
 * hooks stopped firing with no error to explain it.
 *
 * `provider` is a key of PROVIDERS — "claude" or "codex", never anything a
 * caller chose — and is quoted anyway, because that is not a property worth
 * re-deriving at every reading.
 *
 * Exported, with the node path AND the platform injectable, so the escaping can
 * be checked against a path the test names rather than against whatever ran the
 * suite — and against the rule of a platform that suite is not running on. The
 * two rules are genuinely different (POSIX single quotes, cmd.exe doubled
 * double quotes), so without the second parameter the only assertion a test can
 * make is the one its own OS happens to produce, which is how this went five
 * releases with the Windows half of it never once executed.

// perfectly healthy machine. Node has declined to paper over this (nodejs/node
// #29481, closed wontfix: "not something that's really under Node's or libuv's
// control"), and libuv reverted its own four-attempt ladder for the same
// reason. So the policy lives here, where the stakes are known.
//
// The ladder is 10 attempts over ~1.4s, and the second number is the one that
// matters. It used to be 5 over 200ms, which is comfortably enough for the
// indexer and not enough for a scanner: the argument on libuv#2098 for

// `codex login` again. Trading a second of latency against that is not close.

/**
 * Keep this deck registered for as long as it runs, and tell the caller when
 * that stops being true.
 *
 * `onState` hears the first outcome, every change of health, and every
 * re-registration after the first — never a steady state. A deck that cannot
 * write the file has to say so: silently listening while no hook can find it
 * is the failure this exists to end, not a state worth hiding.
 *
 * The interval is unref'd, so it never keeps a finished process alive, and
 * `stop()` must be called before the file is removed on shutdown — otherwise
 * the next tick would put it straight back.
 *
 * `stop()` ANSWERS WITH THE CHECK ALREADY IN FLIGHT, and shutdown has to await
 * it. Clearing the interval stops the next tick; it does nothing about the one
 * that started a moment ago and is currently inside writeFileAtomic. That tick
 * finishes after the unlink and re-creates the file — exactly the "leave the
 * file behind for the hooks to find once nothing is listening" that stopping
 * first is supposed to prevent, reached by the one route stopping first does
 * not cover. The window is a rename and an fsync on POSIX; on Windows it is
 * that plus renameWithRetry's ladder, up to 200ms of sleeping while a scanner
 * holds the target — the platform the retry was written for is the platform
 * where the race is twenty times wider.
 *
 * `run()` never rejects (every failure is a state), so awaiting this cannot
 * throw and cannot outlast one bounded check.

// CLAUDE_EVENTS used to ride along here (#383). It is the events list of the

// because the long justification below belongs to the SECOND export, not this
// one. Which events the deck asks Claude Code for is answered by installHooks
// writing settings.json, which is what the tests read.

// parse is never treated as an empty one, and the replacement is a single
// rename rather than a truncate a reader can land inside. installScript carries
// the same guarantee to the hook scripts themselves, which are the files live
// sessions are actually executing, and renameWithRetry goes out on its own for
// the files writeFileAtomic cannot write — the fetched uv binary in
// uv-bootstrap.mjs — which still need the Windows retry. createTemp goes out for
// the same reason one step lower: codex-auth.mjs needs the collision-free temp
// name but not writeFileAtomic's mode handling, which carries over the target's
// mode and so would leave a brand-new auth.json at whatever the umask allows.
