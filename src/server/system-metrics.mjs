//
// WHY THE SERVER SAMPLES INSTEAD OF ANSWERING ON DEMAND. CPU utilisation is not
// a value you can read; it is a ratio between two readings. `os.cpus()` returns
// cumulative tick counters, so a percentage only exists relative to a previous
// sample. If the sample were taken when a request arrived, two browser tabs
// polling half a second apart would compute their deltas from different
// baselines and print different percentages for the same machine. One timer in
// one process is the only arrangement where that cannot happen — and it is what
// lets `/api/system` hand back a real 60-second history rather than whatever a
// single tab has managed to collect since it was opened.
//
// WHY THIS NEVER TOUCHES pushEvent. Every event that goes through the deck's
// stream is persisted to events.jsonl and held in the 2000-entry ring buffer. A
// three-second sampler would put 1200 entries an hour into both, evicting real
// tool calls from the replay a reconnecting tab receives, and making an ambient
// readout the loudest producer in the application. So this is a plain poll
// endpoint, exactly like /api/quota and /api/codex-usage already are.
