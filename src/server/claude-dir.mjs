// binary, and the question of whether it is here at all.

// ~/.claude, not an overlay, so on a machine where it is set there is nothing in
// ~/.claude for Claude Code to read. Writing hook entries there is silent
// failure of the worst kind: the install reports success, no hook ever fires,
// and the deck stays empty with no error anywhere to explain it.
//
// Every module on the Claude side of the install resolves the directory through
// here, so the deck can never register its hooks in one file while Claude Code
// reads another. hook/hook.js repeats the rule inline rather than importing it:
// it is copied out of the package and run standalone by the host CLI, so it has
// no way back to this module, but it has to resolve the same directory.
//
// The binary list and the presence test moved in beside it for the same reason.
// The list used to sit in quota.mjs under the name quotaClaudeCandidates, where
// it read as a detail of one poller; it is nothing of the kind. It is the answer
// to "where does the `claude` command live", and the deck now asks that question
// at boot, before any quota exists, to decide whether this is a Claude machine
// at all. One list, one caller-visible name, no second spelling to drift.

/**
 * Whether this machine has Claude Code at all — the mirror of hasCodexInstalled().

 * README offers "Claude Code CLI or OpenAI Codex CLI (or both)", and until now
 * nothing anywhere asked which. A Codex-only machine got a Python
 * account-switcher installed for a CLI it does not have, an accounts panel open
 * on first run, and a banner telling it to sign into that CLI (#402).
 *
 * WHY TWO KINDS OF EVIDENCE, OR'd. Neither half is sufficient on its own:
 *
 *   - The binary alone misses the user whose `claude` lives somewhere no list
 *     knows (nvm, mise, volta, a corporate wrapper) and whose deck was launched
 *     from a desktop shortcut with a PATH that never sourced their shell rc.
 *     That user has run Claude Code for months; the config dir proves it.
 *   - The config dir alone misses the machine where Claude Code is installed and
 *     has never been launched, which is exactly the moment somebody installs
 *     both CLIs and starts the deck first. It also cannot be the test on its own
 *     for the opposite reason: THE DECK CREATES THAT DIRECTORY ITSELF. Hence
 *     CLAUDE_USE_MARKERS above, which is a list of things only Claude Code puts
 *     there.
 *
 * WHY NOT CREDENTIALS. A credentials file is not a presence test on macOS at
 * all — the token is in the Keychain and no file exists (#360) — so a machine
 * with Claude Code, signed in and in daily use, would read as Codex-only.
 *
 * WHY NOT "a Claude session was seen". It is the most direct evidence there is,
 * and it arrives far too late: the decision this answers is made at boot, before
 * the server is listening, and a machine whose first session has not started yet
 * would install nothing and show no panel until a restart.
 *
 * The bias is deliberate and one-way. A false yes leaves a Claude-only surface
 * on a Codex machine — today's bug, visible, and the user can pass --no-claude.
 * A false no takes the hooks away from somebody who has Claude Code, which is a
 * deck that stays empty forever. So every check here is generous, the banner
 * says out loud which way it went, and --claude overrides it.
