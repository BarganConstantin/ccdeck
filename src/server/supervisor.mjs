// What bin/agent-dag.js does when the worker dies: bring it back, fetch a
// newer one, or let the whole thing stop — and, for a worker that was killed
// rather than exited, how to hand that on to whoever started the deck. Plus the
// question that now comes BEFORE any of that, since the fetch happens while the
// worker is still serving: whether this upgrade is worth attempting at all.
//
// It lives here rather than inline in the supervisor because the supervisor
// launches a real child process the moment it is imported, so the rule could
// not be checked any other way — and it is a rule with a race in it.
//
// The race: the worker exits 75 because the user clicked Restart, and Ctrl+C
// lands in the same instant. The supervisor's signal handler runs first and
// sets `stopping`, then the exit event arrives carrying 75 — and a supervisor
// that reads the code without asking whether it is still supposed to be
// running spawns a fresh deck AFTER the user stopped it. That deck prints
// `restarted → vX` over the shutdown and keeps serving until the handler's
// 2.5s retry timer happens to kill it; the 76 variant starts a whole npx
// registry fetch first. So `stopping` outranks the code, always.
//
// Ctrl+C reaches this process on every platform we support — POSIX delivers it
// to the foreground process group, and on Windows the console raises
// CTRL_C_EVENT for every process attached to it, which Node surfaces as
// 'SIGINT'. What differs is only how the child dies, which is not this
// function's business.

/**
 * How to report a worker that did not exit at all but was killed by a signal.
 *
 *   { reraise: "SIGHUP", code: 129 } — die of the same signal; `code` is only
 *                                      the fallback if that somehow returns
 *   { reraise: null, code: 129 }     — no signal to die of, exit with the number
 *
 * A supervisor that just exits 0 here tells the shell the deck stopped cleanly
 * after somebody killed it. The status a caller expects is the shell's own
 * convention, 128 + the signal number: 129 for SIGHUP, 143 for SIGTERM. On
 * POSIX the honest way to produce it is to die of the signal rather than to
 * exit with the arithmetic — only that also sets the "killed by a signal" bit
 * every wait(2)-based caller reads, and `$?` comes out the same either way.
 *
 * Windows has no signals: a process there cannot die of one, and `process.kill`
 * against ourselves would be a TerminateProcess with an unrelated status. So
 * the number is all we can offer, and it is still better than 0 — the deck was
 * killed, and whatever started it should be able to see that.
 *
 * The signal numbers come from `os.constants.signals`, which is also the table
 * `process.kill` accepts, so a name missing from it is a name we could not
 * re-raise anyway; it becomes a plain failure exit.

 * signals a worker is most likely to die of, since deck.js does not handle
 * SIGHUP at all and registers the other two only after a boot that takes
 * seconds. For all three the re-raise lands back in our own handler, which
 * finds no child left and exits 0: `kill -HUP` on the deck was reported to the
 * shell as a clean, successful stop. Dropping the handler first restores the
 * default action, which is to die of the signal.

 * What to say when the upgrade that just succeeded took this install with it,

 *
 * `npm i -g ccdeck` performed before #340 nests the deck inside a launcher
 * package. Upgrading such an install now writes the deck itself over that
 * launcher, and npm's reify removes everything that was underneath — including
 * the directory this supervisor and its worker are running from. The process
 * survives, because everything it needs is already loaded. The next spawn does
 * not: bin/deck.js is a path, and npm has just deleted it.
 *
 * That reached the user as `could not start …/bin/deck.js: ENOENT` and an exit
 * 1 — a dead deck and an errno, one click after an upgrade that reported
 * success. Nothing was broken. The new version is on the machine, and the
 * command they typed already points at it, because npm rewrote the bin shim in
 * the same install. The only thing missing was a sentence saying so.
 *
 * Deliberately not a hand-off. This process could spawn the successor's worker
 * instead, and that would be a new worker under an old supervisor — a pair
 * nothing has ever tested together, decided at the worst possible moment. One
 * command the user runs themselves is the smaller promise and the one that
 * cannot go wrong.
 *
 * Pure, and given its two filesystem answers rather than asking for them,
 * because the state it describes only ever exists in a process whose own files
 * were deleted after it started — which no test can produce by spawning one.
