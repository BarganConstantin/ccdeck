// then degrade, rather than picking the floor and printing the same 16 colours
// into a pipe, a CI log and a truecolor emulator alike.
//
// It lives here, apart from bin/deck.js, for the reason supervisor.mjs and
// npx.mjs do: bin/deck.js installs hooks and binds a port the moment it is
// imported, so none of this could be checked any other way — and "what does the
// output look like at 40 columns, with NO_COLOR, on a Windows console" is
// exactly the kind of question that is only ever answered by asserting it.
//
// Nothing here writes anything or reads process state on its own: every input
// (env, isTTY, platform, columns) is a parameter, defaulted from the real thing.
// The two exceptions are the cursor constants, which are strings the caller
// writes, because who restores the cursor and when is a lifecycle question and
// belongs with the lifecycle.

// effectively universal now, and it is the only tier on which the deck's accent
// is actually the deck's accent rather than whatever the user's theme decided

 * subprocess's stack trace is not: fifteen lines scroll the entire startup
 * report away and leave the pulse mid-frame. Reported from Windows (#432),
 * where a broken npm shim put two Node stack traces over the boot output.
 *
 * Three things happen here, and the order matters.
 *
 * The most informative line is chosen rather than the first one, because the

 * removed would still overwrite whatever the deck had drawn on that row — and
 * CRLF is what a Windows child writes, which is the platform this exists for.
 * An ESC would open an escape sequence out of a string the deck did not write.
 *
 * And the result is fitted to the room the caller has left, so the one line
 * stays one line: a message that wraps is two rows, and the `\r` that follows
 * only ever reaches the second of them. The ellipsis defaults to the ASCII one
 * rather than `…`, because callers of this are error paths in modules that
 * know nothing about the terminal's glyph tier — and a `…` on a cmd.exe code
