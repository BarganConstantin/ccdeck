/**
 * The one spelling of a directory, so that a path this process reports and a

 *
 * Resolving symlinks is the half that is easy to think you can skip, because on
 * POSIX a cwd comes from getcwd(3) and has none left in it. Windows has no such
 * guarantee — GetCurrentDirectoryW returns the string the directory was set
 * with, junction, `subst` drive and all — so a workspace reached that way only
 * matches if BOTH sides go through here. The server's rollout watcher keeps its
 * own copy of this rule under the name canonicalCwd, for the Codex sessions that
 * never reach this file; a test walks one path through both. A path that does
 * not resolve keeps its resolved form, which is also what canonicalWorkspace
 * does with a directory the user has not created yet.
 *
 * `.native` IS THE RULE, not a detail. fs.realpathSync is a JavaScript
 * lstat-and-readlink walk that resolves symlinks and junctions and nothing else;
 * fs.realpathSync.native is GetFinalPathNameByHandleW, which also expands a DOS
 * 8.3 short component to its long form. This used to call the plain one while
 * the server's canonicalCwd went through the native one, so the moment a path
 * arrived short — `%TEMP%` under a shortened profile directory, which is what
 * every GitHub Windows runner has — the two canonicalisers that exist to agree
 * disagreed by a whole path: C:\Users\RUNNER~1\… against C:\Users\runneradmin\….
 * canonicalWorkspace in src/server/index.mjs says the rest of it, including why
 * the long form is the canonical one; all three sites name `.native` out loud.
 *
 * Exported for that test: it is half of what `--workspace` means, and a
 * predicate handed an already-canonical path cannot show that the caller
 * canonicalises.

/**
 * Of the decks about to be posted this event, which ones should also write it

 * they should all draw it. Persisting is not: they all default to the same
 * <claude config dir>/agent-dag/events.jsonl, so each of them appending its own
 * copy wrote every event once per running deck. The file then grew N times as
 * fast, rotated N times as often, and every replay of it ingested each tool
 * call N times, which is what put duplicate tools and duplicate bubbles on the
 * canvas after a restart.
 *
 * Decks are therefore grouped by the log file each one names in its discovery
 * record, and one deck per group is elected. Grouping by the file rather than
 * counting decks is what keeps the overrides honest: a deck run with
 * `--history` sits alone in its own group and always writes, a deck run with
 * `--no-persist` reports no file and can never be elected to write for one that
 * does, and a deck too old to report either keeps the behaviour it had before
 * this rule existed. Within a group the lowest port wins — a fixed rule, so the
 * same deck holds the file for as long as it is up and the next one inherits it
 * as soon as that deck is gone.
 *
 * The platform is a parameter, like cwdInWorkspace's, so the case-folding half
 * is testable from any machine.
 *
 * src/server/log-writer.mjs repeats this rule for the events no hook delivers —
 * the ones the server builds itself from Codex's rollout files — because this
 * script is copied out of the package and cannot import it. A test compares the
 * two directly: they decide for the same decks, and a disagreement is a line

 * fresh random token into its discovery file at startup; this hook asks the
 * listener to hash that token against a nonce it has never seen, and sends the
 * payload only if the answer matches. A stranger on the port cannot answer
 * without the token, and the nonce is new every time, so an answer overheard
 * earlier is worth nothing. Note the direction: the hook never transmits the

 * that loses a whole deck's events, and it buys nothing now that the election no
