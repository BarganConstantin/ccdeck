//
// Nothing in the report has to finish before the socket opens, and the window
// this opens is narrow on purpose — the discovery file and the browser are both
// still written after the report, so the only callers who can arrive inside it
// are a tab left open by an earlier deck and the user's own curl:
//
//   • the event log is replayed and the sequence counter primed INSIDE
//     startServer, before it binds — so /events and /api/events answer from a
//     full buffer from the first connection, not a growing one.
//   • the hook install can only make hooks fire; a hook that fires early finds
//     no discovery file and posts nowhere, exactly as it does today.
//   • claude-swap: cswapBin memoizes only a lookup that WORKED, so a probe
//     landing mid-install caches nothing and the next one asks again — see
//     resetCswapBin's note. The accounts panel can report the tool missing for
//     the second it is missing, and answers properly the moment it is not.
//   • ccusage: getRunner awaits the very `_installing` promise primeCcusage
//     started, so a request in this window joins that install rather than
//     racing a second one.
//
// Settled into a tagged result rather than left bare, for the reason every job

                           the events log, ~/.agents-deck/ and claude-swap all stay
  -h, --help               Show this help
  -v, --version            Print the version and exit

A flag that takes a value never swallows the next flag. If the value is missing,
empty, or itself looks like a flag — \`${PRODUCT} --workspace \$UNSET --no-persist\`
after the shell has dropped an unset variable — the flag is reported, left on its
default, and the token it would have eaten is parsed as the flag it is.
