// Supervisor. Owns one thing: the worker's lifecycle.
//
// Why this exists at all: Node caches every module at import, so a deck that is
// running when an upgrade lands keeps executing the old code until the process
// is replaced. The deck can now see that (GET /api/version) — this is the half
// that can act on it.
//
// The tempting shortcut is to have the server respawn itself and exit. Every
// version of that is worse than it looks:
//   • the replacement races the dying listener, and startServer answers
//     EADDRINUSE by binding one of ten RANDOM ports in 4318–4400 — so the tab
//     you are looking at reconnects forever next to a healthy invisible server;
//   • an orphan spawned from a dying parent leaves the shell's foreground
//     process group, so Ctrl+C stops reaching it;
//   • with stdio ignored it also loses the banner, the URL line and every
//     console.error the server writes.
// A parent that stays alive avoids all three: the child is dead — and its
// listening socket released — before the next one is spawned, stdio is
// inherited so the terminal is unchanged, and Ctrl+C keeps working because the
// process group never changes.
//
// The upgrade path has one more constraint, learned the expensive way: the
// worker must not be torn down to find out whether an upgrade is possible. It
// used to be — the worker exited 76, and only then did npx discover it was
// offline — so every failed update cost a full outage and could be retried
// identically forever. Now the worker ASKS (an `upgrade` message), the fetch
// happens beside it while it keeps serving, and only a fetch that worked is
// answered with the exit that gives up the port. See prefetchUpgrade.
//
// Everything else the deck does still lives in bin/deck.js. This file must stay
// boring: it is the one process that is never replaced.

/**
 * Which package an npx upgrade here names, and the spec that installs it — or
 * null when this deck was not started by npx and there is nothing to re-run.
 *
 * One function because there is one answer, and the worker above us reaches it
 * independently: `upgradeName` in self-update.mjs resolves the npx case as
 * `bareSpecName(npxRestartSpec(pkgRoot, installedName(pkgRoot)))`, and
 * everything registry-shaped on that side — the dist-tag it fetched, the marker
 * it cached the answer in, the failure note the browser reads — is keyed by it.
 * This supervisor keyed the same four things off `npxRestartSpec(PKG_ROOT)`
 * with the module's own default, which is the literal string "agents-deck".
 *
 * Both read `_npx/<hash>/package.json`, so they agreed for as long as that
 * metadata was readable, and #340 made the disagreement matter when it is not:
 * the three names are one tarball now, so the manifest under a `npx ccdeck` run
 * genuinely says `ccdeck` where it once always said `agents-deck`. A cache
 * directory written by an npm whose `_npx.packages` layout differs — or a
 * truncated file — split the two apart: the worker asked npm about `ccdeck` and
 * read `.restart-failed-ccdeck-<pid>` while this process wrote
 * `.restart-failed-agents-deck-<pid>`, took `lastKnownLatest("agents-deck")`
 * off a marker nobody had written — so `target` was null and upgradeAttempt's
 * per-target cap degraded to "any failure counts" — and relaunched
 * `npx -y agents-deck@latest`, moving a `npx ccdeck` user onto a different
 * published name. The note went where the browser never looks, which is the
 * exact class of bug NOTE_PREFIX's naming exists to prevent.
 *
 * So the fallback is the name npm's rename wrote into this build's own manifest,
 * which is what the worker falls back to as well. Read on each call rather than
 * once at import for the reason installedVersion gives: the manifest is a file
 * on disk, and this process outlives more than one of them.
